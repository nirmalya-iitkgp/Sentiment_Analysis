Final Words Very good and fit to the need on back ugly look change. Then sale will  be double the target. No doubt.
Areas of improvement Interior furnishing, window side mirror turning signal lamps to be provided. Dash board and other interior are to be styled in an elegant way to attract family users.They may then prfer the vehicle since the same being much economic in fuel efficiency. Blootooth facility,Good audio system. these are the features attracts people.People will compare in style appearence the are ignorant of technical features only cares fuel efficiency.Exterior shoul be improved upto the mark.I am writing allthese things  of the diesel version. I thought lyland being a traditional manufacturer ,ought to have cure all the minute minus marks while launching a vehicle like this type especially when our market is competing with foriegners,=. Lyland also have good tie up with nissan and others. It may happened due to the lack of eminent designers or experienced top officials in this launch."	Adv.S.Manoj Kumar

Leyland brand in CVs, NISSAN TECHNOLOGY	Should have been Rear Wheel driven	"Exterior
Its NISSAn Evalia with more aggressive front due to bold head lamp. It looks biggest among most of the peers. Looks bigger than Evalia, Enjoy, Duster, Terrano, Ertiga, Ecosport etc. Though SUMO   Bolaro clearly are biiger beasts
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
Interior space is more or less the same in 7-seater SUVs between Rs.6 Lakhs to Rs.12 Lakhs. Features in Stile are similar to Evalia and seen in every vehicle.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
The engine is seen in many cars from Mahindra Verito, NIssan Terrano, Duster, Evalia etc. engine is being used in many cars but not as popular as FIAT's 1.3 MJD. Performance could have been better, if the vehicle was Rear Wheel driven. Read Wheel drive is good for carrying loads. Front wheel drive more for speed
Ride Quality   Handling
Front wheel drive in the tall car makes ride quality a compromise. Handling is also a problem, on sharp turns at times it feels, the vehicle could be over-turning
Final Words
 Rear Wheel driven and lower priced vehicle could have been better
Areas of improvement  
Drive should be Rear Wheel and pricing is aggressive, specially compared to Enjoy, Ertiga and Old horses SUMO Gold   Bolero

Tyre size seems small.so with fully loaded small warbling we feel.average speed of 70 to 90 km without fear.while drive 70km/hr its gives as house on road feeling.

Leyland brand in CVs, NISSAN TECHNOLOGY	Pricing, RWD is better for heavy vans, CVs etc.	"Exterior
Familiar NISSAN EVALIA. Though its looks more bold, due to big looking Headlamps
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
 Space is sufficient. Its more or less similar to similar priced vehicles like SUMO, Bolero, Enjoy, Eeco etc.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Ashok Leyland should have changed Evalia from Front Wheel driven to Rear Wheel driven. As Front Wheel is good for lighter vehicles, speed driving. For pushing loads Rear Wheel Drive is better. Can you imagine a truck OR bus with front wheel drive..? Here SUMO, Bolero, Enjoy etc. have edge. Rear Wheel driven vehicles perform way better in carrying loads compared to front wheel driven
Ride Quality   Handling
Its a tall Van. In this price range, ENJOY, Sumo, ERTIGA etc. to be much better than Stile OR Evalia
Final Words
Enjoy, SUMO   Bolero are clear winner due to pricing. Leyland, should get prices down a little and change technology to make it Rear Wheel driven
Areas of improvement  
 Rear Wheel driven would have been much better, Pricing. Leyaland ahs to expand its network for smaller passenger vehicles

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
