Very small SUV .

Price
The after sales service and spares parts
backseat is a bit cramped
colour combination &  Easy Hands
Compared with other sports cars, there's no negetive markings
No service standard
Company is a cheat. 40K servicing cost for every 6k km. No GPS, uncomfortable rear seats, no spare t
there is nothing bad about it

NOT A SINGLE THING
I find the paint job easily scratched.
It is just a crossover with no off road ability
None
Pathetic manufacturing quality
Run flat fails, No spare.
spacing, price
common man's enemy,lass back seat comfort,not roomy enough for tall people

bad looks,a bit congested
Vibrations to steering wheel ....
My x1 Marrakech brown has very thin coat,rear seating cramped
sun roof not a desirable feature in hot country like INDIA
shouldn't speak if u buy it u must be more a man than a driver a bit harder drive
No new exciting features

Price price price price And also The Price As I Own One of this
Fuel economy,interiors are not so attractive...
It;s very extravagant and is impossible for the car loving people to afford to buy it.
Price,Interiors,Cramped space,Can be driven only in 6-8 lane superhighways
Not for Everyday drive
Bad Interiors, Low fuel economy

"Exterior Really Awesome 
 Stylish Cab design then others. Nice Tail Lamp   Head lamp. Aerodynamics profile.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
Except middle window Stile is having bucket seats for enough confort. Every passengers have separate holder to restrict from bering disbalancd in turns. Color combination of seats and floor is quite eye pleasing and dash board design is like cock pit with comfort range of gear lever.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Best is fuel economy which is unmatched from any of the MPV avaialble in market with Less Engine noise. AC also properly working while vehicle is just moving. No shifting noise observed during gear shifting. It is available in deisel only which is one of the great advantage.
Ride Quality   Handling
 Smooth handling   great riding comfort for long drive as well as short drive. better passenger comfort due to rear AC vent   enough leg space.  
Final Words
 Superb MPV, Value for money, comfortable for hotel taxi, ambulance   Van purpose.
Areas of improvement  
 Rear suspension should be coil, small Slidable middle window should be replace by fully opnable big size window.

Areas of improvement Interior furnishing, window side mirror turning signal lamps to be provided. Dash board and other interior are to be styled in an elegant way to attract family users.They may then prfer the vehicle since the same being much economic in fuel efficiency. Blootooth facility,Good audio system. these are the features attracts people.People will compare in style appearence the are ignorant of technical features only cares fuel efficiency.Exterior shoul be improved upto the mark.I am writing allthese things  of the diesel version. I thought lyland being a traditional manufacturer ,ought to have cure all the minute minus marks while launching a vehicle like this type especially when our market is competing with foriegners,=. Lyland also have good tie up with nissan and others. It may happened due to the lack of eminent designers or experienced top officials in this launch."

Its NISSAn Evalia with more aggressive front due to bold head lamp. It looks biggest among most of the peers. Looks bigger than Evalia, Enjoy, Duster, Terrano, Ertiga, Ecosport etc. Though SUMO   Bolaro clearly are biiger beasts
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
Interior space is more or less the same in 7-seater SUVs between Rs.6 Lakhs to Rs.12 Lakhs. Features in Stile are similar to Evalia and seen in every vehicle.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
The engine is seen in many cars from Mahindra Verito, NIssan Terrano, Duster, Evalia etc. engine is being used in many cars but not as popular as FIAT's 1.3 MJD. Performance could have been better, if the vehicle was Rear Wheel driven. Read Wheel drive is good for carrying loads. Front wheel drive more for speed
Ride Quality   Handling
Front wheel drive in the tall car makes ride quality a compromise. Handling is also a problem, on sharp turns at times it feels, the vehicle could be over-turning
Final Words
 Rear Wheel driven and lower priced vehicle could have been better
Areas of improvement  
Drive should be Rear Wheel and pricing is aggressive, specially compared to Enjoy, Ertiga and Old horses SUMO Gold   Bolero

Familiar NISSAN EVALIA. Though its looks more bold, due to big looking Headlamps
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
 Space is sufficient. Its more or less similar to similar priced vehicles like SUMO, Bolero, Enjoy, Eeco etc.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Ashok Leyland should have changed Evalia from Front Wheel driven to Rear Wheel driven. As Front Wheel is good for lighter vehicles, speed driving. For pushing loads Rear Wheel Drive is better. Can you imagine a truck OR bus with front wheel drive..? Here SUMO, Bolero, Enjoy etc. have edge. Rear Wheel driven vehicles perform way better in carrying loads compared to front wheel driven
Ride Quality   Handling
Its a tall Van. In this price range, ENJOY, Sumo, ERTIGA etc. to be much better than Stile OR Evalia
Final Words
Enjoy, SUMO   Bolero are clear winner due to pricing. Leyland, should get prices down a little and change technology to make it Rear Wheel driven
Areas of improvement  
 Rear Wheel driven would have been much better, Pricing. Leyaland ahs to expand its network for smaller passenger vehicles

 an electric assist at low revs could easily improve performance...but fullfledged hybrid would be of a different class/category ....a different vanquish not  the Vanquish..(i mean it may not be called hybrid as such):)

"I expect to see this car nominated for the best car of 2014
4.0-litre V8 petrol engine Just perfect for family driving and the car you definitely want to have when you need travel a few hundred miles.
 
0-100 in 3.9 seconds.
The car is manufactured in order to provide driver satisfaction mainly speed and endurance like any other Audi only offering a top speed of 249.448 km/h.
 
The Value of money may not be very attracting but when you look at the car , its features and what this locomotive can do, I assure you it will give you your moneys worth.
As per the order in the Audi sports cars,
The RS7 places itself below the R8 and above the RS6.

                                                RS7 THE TRUTH IN ENGINEERING
On to the beauty. The RS 7 is one of the most pleasing cars to look at built this year. There&rsquo;s simply no unflattering angle, detail, or protuberance to be found, inside or out. Opt for the carbon package and you can add a subtle touch of menace for those with sharp eyes, but outwardly, the RS 7 just looks like an A7 with a certain edge.
Inside, the RS 7 gains some performance touches, but it&rsquo;s the high-end trim on offer that will really wow you and your next set of passengers. One of our favorites is the black oak and aluminum sandwich material that looks as sharp as a fresh tuxedo, but feels as durable as a ship&rsquo;s deck.

Full Review
Exterior
 Its a very good looking car. It looks better than the Merc E class and the BMW 5 series. Even if you care a figure about cars, you just can't stop craning your neck if this car passes by. The A3 looks long and sturdy. The tail lights have been augmented with the R8 inspired lenses that cut through the haze of blowing snow.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
 The audio system sounds great. The audi drive select system is just cool. The front and rear seats have good legroom. Heated seats make the car more comfortable.  It's cabin is perfect. The A3 also features the audi's Multi Media Interface. (MMI) which provides access to a number of functions via a computer screen rather than buttons anad dials,
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 The audi beats all it's rivals in performance because of it's massively powerful 3.0 V6 engine. The 6 speed automatic transmission is great. There is a choice of V6 or V8 power in the united states. The most basic models get front wheel drive, but most come equipped with the company,s quattro all wheel drive system.
Ride Quality   Handling 
 Audi should improve its ride quality and handling. Audi has already improved in these categories in the new Audi A3.                                                                                                                                         Audi is the most powerful because of its quattro engine and all wheel drive system.
Areas of he improvement  
 Audi should improve its ride and handling. The interiors are a bit cranny. I'm sure audi new A3 has mproved these areas as well.

Sometimes a bright idea really does shine. Case in point, our iconic LED daytime running lights and LED headlights. While they were intended to help make you more visible to other drivers and provide unparalleled visibility at night, we thought they could also serve double duty as a beautiful styling statement. It&rsquo;s just another way we&rsquo;re lighting the way on design.

"I recently purchased a elephant called Audi Q7 - 3.0 TDi.
So far I was driving Merc cars and it is the first MUV I purchased.
This machine is much better, intellegent, powerful, safe compair to earlier cars. The power   controls are superb compair to size.
The vehical must be purchased minimum with-
1. Advance parking system.
2. Adaptive cruise control
  finally 3. Adaptive lights ... due to size of vehical on Indian roads   traffic condition.
The only draback I have seen that Audi must provide parking camera for front like given for rear instead of Radar control. (The screen can be divided in 2 parts).
Also, somehow I was feeling comfortable when driving above 150 Km/hr (maybe due to sudden acceleration or I was familier so far with with cars   not SUV/MUVs)"

"Exterior: Mini Q7. Sporty but not great!
 
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort): XUV 500 has more features for one-third price!
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox: Same across all Audi/ VW group cars. It is just okay for city but I will think twice before purchasing this car if I drive on a highway and am trying to overtake a very long Truck/ trailer. There is lag between gears in the Automatic...
 
Ride Quality   Handling: Just okay, dfinitely not worth the price!
 
Final Words: Audi Q5 costs 34,000 dollars inUSA (approx 17.5 lakhs). Q3 should cost not more that 25,000 dollar (12.5 lakhs). It costs 'thrice' as much in India. Not justified... Also Audi is not as premier a brand in the US and Europe as a 'Merc' and 'BMW'. I would look at Volvo XC60 over either BMW X1 or X3 and/or Audi Q3 or Q5...
 
Areas of improvement  : Space allocation could be better. Also, somehow I feel that the Audi Cars as a bit too flashy for my taste which is clearly visible by Audi's buyers in India!
 
 "
"Exterior All Audis have a sense of feminine character.The Q3 doesn't miss on this one.The LED's are a sure delight! The front grill looks classy. The front and rear bumpers have been neatly done. The rear spoiler adds more coolness to the car.Bits of chrome can be found at few places.The rear part of the car looks better when compared to the front portion.The smallness of the car shouldn't give you much of a thought  considering the fact that the traffic is going haywire as the days go by.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) The interiors have got a plasticky feel. There are places where wood has been added. The steering feels light when the car is slow and gradually tightens up as the car gains speed.The audio quality is top notch!The front seats are comfortable.They can be adjusted electrically.The infotainment panel can be reached easily.Steering controls have been provided.Bluetooth conectivity is a standard feature. The car is technologically advanced.The car has been fitted with many sensors and 12 airbags.The rear doors are small. It's surprising that people from Audi haven't provided a rear hand rest.Rear leg room is okay. Vents for AC have been provided in the back seat.it's kind of cramped in the rear seat.The hood space is good given the size of the car.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The engine sounds grumpy when idle and at low speeds. The fuel economy is pretty decent.It  can run for 8 kilo metres on a litre of diesel in the city and 10 kilometres on a highway. The 7-speed gear box is very good.The sport mode should be a delight for the driver.
Ride Quality   Handling Ride quality is excellent!The car is ideal for both city and off-roading.It can be swiveled easily in the traffic. The suspension system rocks in the Q3!
Final Words Go for it if money is not the issue.  
Areas of improvement BMW's X1 is a serious competitor. Price has to be looked into by Audi.It's kind of over priced in India but still makes a better package."

 if u have much money and used this car regularly so u can purchase it,its a perfact car for driving and deasel sound is not hard and silent cockpit

 its good for long drive but not good for off-road it can be melefic for u on off road but on highway it's maintenance less car and black colour is good looking among all colours go and purchase if u have 2cr.spare budget for car u can drive freely bmw is high maitenence car than a4"
"Seems to be a very flashy and elegant car though i am an onlooker only.
Hopes to own it one day.
Despite making super premium cars, why Audi is not able to make its presence feel in India. Few Merc and Benz cars comes cheaper but has excellent brand value with their (Merc) presence in common peoples mind. 
May be Audi have to be agressive in India"

Nice and elegant 
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
 The front seat passenger and co passenger seats are confortable and spacious. The rear room space was rather in adequate for tall peaople.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Very smooth and effortless.
Ride Quality   Handling
 Ride quality was comfortable and being in command for self driven person. I feel for chaffuer driven, the rear experience is ok not luxurous.
Final Words
 This is a treat for people who want to enjoy driving this subtle and luxurous beast. I was expecting some pwerful and luxurious SUV something different from fortuner or BMW X 1. I did find this vehicle meeting all the parameter for a entrepreneur on the move as it has simple and crucial features and voice command actions promptly recognized and accepted by the command center. Or basic safety feature on vehicle remaining firm in parking mode, hence very stable in inclined or declining position. 
Areas of improvement  
 I am expecting some efforts to improve the rear seat experience. As the vehicle is all wheel drive I expect more fine tuning of the engine..

best available car to own and drive , any day better than a bmw or merc ,feature list include bose audio ,reverse camera , 4 wheel drive , faster,adaptive air suspension , best fuel aconomy are few words to describe audi a6 3.0 tdi quattro as the best in class available car , rather the best car in the world .....vaibhav
"In the end its the car that all would like to have.
Spell bound by its elegance it was a royal experience to write this review of one of the most exquisite cars i have ever seen.
The x-factor of this Vehicle is its looks, which are far more penetrating that any car in recent history.
Its enormous power is what its competitors in its segment should be worried about.
Looking like a bison, it really makes its presence felt on the floor and commands the most intimate thought of the onlookers."
The Audi A6 has a funky Bauhaus style that makes it stand out from its German rivals, while competing on merit with the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and BMW 5 Series models. While the Mercedes and BMW models are "safe" choices, the Audi buyer is more of a psychological risk taker, more on the cutting edge and more willing to be different.
"Exterior
Its a very good looking car. It looks better than the Merc E class and  the BMW 5 series. Even if you care a figure about cars, you just can't  stop craning your neck if this car passes by. The A6 looks long and  sturdy. The tail lights have been augmented with the R8 inspired lenses  that cut through the haze of blowing snow.

"Driven 2000kms. On expressways, it's a sheer delight. Things missing are rear view mirror fader, no GPS, parking lights,rear view camera, rear seat hand rest.
AC cooling is not great. There is no convenient place to keep mobile. 
For the price, front seat ventilation should have been there."
awesome babe magnet,would have been good if it was a 2 seater, will own one very soon.the car is just awesome.compared to x6 this is very good,all i look in to is speed and not much on mileage,some cars are meant for something,if we look at mileage then shoud go for some low end cars and not these kind of sports car.

I drove my friends car. It gives a gorfeous look to both the driver and also the comfort level to feel good and proud. I wish to buy 1 as soon as possible. The more i will write the less it will be counted... Good things have no reason to be explored.
Its a fantastic car.Youth will enjoy as it is the second fastest car(300km/hr top speed).It has dual tone body.In black its really astonishing.Its xenon lamps offer very good visiblity.For indian roads this car is not suitable for daily

  The new Q3 has retained the overall design of the current model but features a new face and updated rear along with new shoes. Mechanically, the vehicle sports uprated engine meeting Euro 6 norms. Moreover, recently Audi India has added a new top-end variant in its Q3 SUV line-up for the Indian market. Launched at INR 38.40 Lakh (ex-showroom Mumbai), the Q3 Dynamic now comes with several cosmetic updates, including new 17' inch 5 spoke &lsquo;Trias&rsquo; design alloy wheels, panoramic sunroof, a full chrome front grille and clear lens LED tail lights.

Final Words
Competition does amazing things. Not only do the manufacturers try to get one up on each other by making a better product, but the us consumers get a load of options to choose as well before we put our hard earned money down. Now the Q3 was Audi's entry level SUV offering which proved to be an extremely able product and made sure Audi racks up those massive sales numbers.

 Its not need to improve anything but somewhere mileage
Audi went all-in on aluminum with the first-generation rs7 that arrived here for 1997. It must have had a crystal ball: Now that all automakers are looking to meet aggressive CAFE targets through, among other things, the shedding of pounds, Audi&rsquo;s bet on aluminum seems prescient. This head start with the most abundant metal in the earth&rsquo;s crust means the third-generation A8 is a paragon of mass management, lightweight manufacturing, and big-car fuel efficiency. But it also represents the best the brand has to offer in terms of&thinsp;executive-class luxury, performance, and technology.
After it posted a narrow victory over the BMW 750iL and the Jaguar XJL Supercharged in a May 2011 comparison test, we decided to put the 2012 A8L through a long-term test, albeit without the $12,500 Executive Rear Seat package. With an as-tested price of&thinsp;$100,875, though, our Emerald Black Metallic test car still offered corner-office comfort. In the interest of &thinsp;journalistic investigation, we added the following to the $85,575 A8L base price: $3000 for the Driver Assistance package (full-speed adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, blind-spot warning, and forward-crash warning), $2300 for night vision, $2300 for dynamic steering and a torque-vectoring rear differential, $2000 for 22-way-adjustable and massaging front seats, and $1600 for LED headlights. A $1500 faux-suede headliner, $1200 20-inch wheels shod with summer rubber, the $800 Cold Weather package, and $600 dual-pane side glass were simply indulgences on our part.

 Will never buy again. Such a nice car but so steep in maintainence that it is prohibitve to buy Again.   A friend of mine has Q5 and was selling it when maintainence called.  Imagine six lakhs gone in one shot and he was trying to sell in 15 lakhs Maintainence should be reduced.Maintainence should be reduced.Maintainence should be reduced.Maintainence should be reduced.Maintainence should be reduced.Maintainence should be reduced.Maintainence should be reduced.

iam using this model for about one year in europe. u canot campare this model with benz E class. first of all audi is not a super luxuary car. Benz has a super resale value. in europe it has a minor value than benze.Benz has more comfort than any models than Audi.

I have no practical experience with the car. The features mentioned in the specification book is mind blowing. The cost is excessively high. THe car is not actually for common people. The ultimately luxurious car . The king of road rules the road like a king.

this car is the favorite of all. it has a great elegant and astonishing look. the features and the leather seating and the comfort level it provides it nothing and can't be phrased in words. its even better when you have a experience with the vehicle your selves. its like riding a vehicle with the power of a bull when you drive.

the name is enough to describe the car and its worthm it is not dependent on any explanation or praise as it is a world class product, now in india. though not many people can afford to buy this baby but still it has carved a niche for itself.
"A Very good and excellent Car.  A pleasure in driving.  Hazardless and smooth driving experience, let it be a short or a long Drive or even for pilgrim or Bharth Darshan.  A World Class Car. 
Efficient and smooth running with powerful shocks is a fine experience to carry entire family for any function or a farm house."
great performance... witth a great peckup. and its a perfrect for the style and new look with great technology,... but the petrol economy is not very good compare to ther cars present in india. and come in a vibrant coulorsss.. must buy for a great new exprience.

Final Words  Awesome o words to describe a car like Audi The new Audi Q7 is unmatched in terms of style, performance, safety,  comfort and driving dynamics providing customers the complete driving  experience which Audi is known for! The Audi Q7 has been the big daddy of the Indian SUV scene ever since it  was introduced to the country a few years back. Now with its minor  facelift, the Q7 adds to its menacing presence with bucket loads of  style embodied by the Audi design signature. Loaded with gadgets  including the fabulous Multi Media Interface, the Q7 has by far been the  last word in luxury SUVs leaving almost all of its competitors behind  not only in sales figures but also on the road with its choice of 3.0  TDI, 3.6 FSI and 4.2 FSI power plants.
Areas of improvement  If more power added to the  engine will give more pleasure

i dont have much driven experience with thiscar, but i have seen people using and also display in a exibition.people take care of this car so much.on roads it goes flying with great looks and also on any kind of cars.its an aspirational car for India 2009
If i were in a condition to buy this car, i would have surely bought this car. This makes a style statement as well as has its own class. The R8 is indeed a car for the cream section of the society. Its all the colours are very attractrive and compliments the cars looks and design.
no good pick cars in mid segment with great pick and power with loaded safety features and style also lack in style with the front dash board and music system provided just ordinary as expected by the present generation. Further the cars needs to be improved on the headlights focus which should be higher side with respect to the visibility and clarity which is not available in the existing. adding on further are the tyre sizes which needs to be broader with less in height will add the character of the car for the generation x.
"We like the indian cars in a grand manner. It fulfill the requirement. The stylish  comfortable look is admirable.
The cast is higher than the worth of the car. So it is available in lesser price and if it suits the higer middle class requirement it ll be in higher value."

 The engine is pretty good and has negligible noise compared to other cars of this class. It is very powerful, though I own only the 3.0L one it is still really good both on and off the road

 The ride is superb with really brilliant and subtle handling. It is very stable off the road and has brilliant road sense. It rises and falls adjusting to the road condition using the air suspensions.

 If you can afford it dont miss out its a great deal . I just love it. Would upgrade if a new version arrives.

This car is my out of rang car so i never do plan for purache this car if god give me help for purchase this car i will do it.
Its very seldom that you find yourself in a car which was created to showcase a concept which was meant for only Sports Cars. This car is a beast no doubt about that....takes all the cars hand down...when it comes to the styling....comfort.....power....features....the list goes on....however the only issue with this beast is that the jungle is too crowded within city limits for this beast to have the clear space to move around in full vigour....the SUV is huge. The only other aspect that i can think about is that this SUV drinks a lot.....but I guess for a person who would be spending for this car with the price tag this car comes at....fuel is hardly a concern.any which ways ...if i am driving this car, there's nobody on the road ....at least in India who can challenge me ....onroad OR offroad.

The AUDI A4 is a really good car.Its packed with features,Its stylish,Its luxurious.It can give a merc a run for its money.There are some downsides too like the Dash layout is not impressive and the suspension is low so it cannot go up on speed brakers too well.At the end Its a great car manufactured by a great company  AUDI.

"After having done 5000 Kilometers in 2 months after purchase would conclude to have made the right decision to buy the a4 after almost finalising the Beemer  with stunning exterior which is ahead turner wherever you go as compared to the other 2 good cars from germany.
The turbo boost in the sport mode is like a rocket a little less than the 3 series but  that the a 4 can be chipped to 172 bhp awaiting when  Audi starts doing it without affecting the warranty. The best thing is to see the cars disappear in the rear view mirror.
Having driven the octi and the incredible mileage trying to come to terms with the 11 12 kpl avg of the a4, the engine is super silent to all other similar cars in its class The 17 inch wheels with the parking package is a must in Indian road conditions The downside, no park assist available as in the passat nor it's available as an after fitment similar is voice mmi control is not available along with navigation something now seen in the ford fiesta.
Audi should enable the remote key for the windows."

its cool car with a good mileage and style also comfort and performance Good fuel economy, Good style good value for money"
The Audi A4 holds the distinction of single-handedly reviving the Audi brand after its big sales slump some two decades ago. Launched in the mid-'90s, the A4 quickly proved a favorite among luxury-car buyers thanks to its handsome, well-finished cabin, sharp handling and available Quattro all-wheel drive. Tight panel gaps, high-quality materials and firm, comfortable seating give the interior the proper European ambience, while a supple ride and willing performance make the Audi A4 a great road trip choice .................

"Exterior
 Exterior are good but not such awesome if you are going to buy it buy it in a red color it would be great actually this color suits the car 
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
 Interior are very good,it is different from other cars the best thing that i loved was the interior if you are going to buy this car you will be very satisfied with the interior belive me!!!!!! 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Mileage is not such good but when you drive this car you will really fell that you are driving a AUDI car fuel ecnomy should be great but in this car mileage is very bad 
Ride Quality   Handling
 Great to drive and handling is also great
Final Words
 I think in this rate this car is best if you have the money to maintain it properly 
Areas of improvement  
 If the company give space a litter more it would be great if its possible increase the mileage

"PERFORMANCE:
No need to explain abt AUDI's Performance. It's a drivers car. 3.2 FSI quatro's performance is outstanding. 0-100 in 7.2 sec. is more than enough for indian roads. size of the car is also not so big so that u can drive comfortably in city.
STYLE:
The aymbol of AUDI itself tells everyone around the car that Im LUGSORY. It also gives a sporty look.
COMFORT:
The comfort in back seat is OK. This is not a passenger's car. It's a drivers car."

the base model of audi a4 costs rs 28 lkh.
wth addng taxes the price reaches whooping 34.5 lkhs.
n if u wanna buy it on emis for 5 yrs, the total landed cost reaches to rs. 41 lkhs."
audi r8 has a very good looking, stylish exteriors and interiors. its a dream car for most of the indians. it is highly costly, but this ride will make you the center of attraction. superb acceleration and a mind bogling top speed but the car lack in fuel efficiency.

"linea should have also been nominated in any catogory its good value for money.
 There&rsquo;s more to Italy than pizza and pasta. Besides the allure of Sicilian women, the work of great Italian artists can be viewed in museums worldwide. Their great motoring marques engender a unique sense of passion in drivers and car enthusiasts. Some of the best looking cars in the world were sketched in various Italian design centers. The only Italian car company in India, FIAT hasn&rsquo;t exactly lived up to the tradition of making gorgeous pieces of art on four wheels. The FIATs of yesteryears were nice and the more recent Palio too looked classy, at least on the outside. Yet I can&rsquo;t help but wonder; has the Italian marque forgotten its roots? One look at FIAT&rsquo;s latest baby for the Indian market, the Linea and you will be screaming &lsquo;Hell No&rsquo;! Just like the Mafiosi that the Italians are infamous for, it looks like the new C segment contender is loaded with enough ammunition for an aggressive assault on the competition. Although delayed by months, can the FIAT Linea overthrow its closest Indian rivals, the Ford Fiesta and the Chevrolet Optra Magnum? Among the three top of the line diesel models, it is the Linea that demands a second glance. Curvaceous with the right angles, this FIAT is a bold departure from the cars we are used to seeing on Indian roads. Based on an extended Grande Punto platform (a car that literally saved FIAT from going bankrupt), the Linea is a work of art. At least I think so. Its huge size can shame other cars in this segment for sheer road presence. The car&rsquo;s exterior styling is elegant, dynamic and typically Italian. The pulled back twin pod headlamps with a rather huge two part grille dominate the front. There are no sharp edges instead there is a seamless flow of body lines. The swooping A pillar as well as the way the roof meets the C pillar and the boot impart a grand look to the car. The rear is equally eye catching with a bulged rear windscreen and a muscular boot lid. The competition, on the other hand, fails to match the Linea for sheer graceful looks. The Fiesta clearly feels like a smaller car. Almost eleven inches off the Linea&rsquo;s length, the Ford is also narrowest of all the three cars. The Fiesta was revamped with fresh sportier looks recently but it&rsquo;s a shame Ford isn&rsquo;t giving the racy body kit (found on the S petrol model) as an option on the diesel variant. It doesn&rsquo;t have the same eye catching appeal that the Linea or for that matter, the Optra has to an extent. The car is also a hit with the taxi segment and that does hinder its brand image a bit. The Optra Magnum looks posh. Most Optras sold are in black and our test car toocame in the same shade. With a rather sharp and low front end, the narrow tear drop like headlamps are flanked on either side of the chrome lipped grille. The Chevy almost matches the Fiat in length, though it is lowest in height here. The rear of the Optra with a small chrome lip and vertically stacked small tail lamps looks equally pleasing. Both the Linea and the Optra come with 15-inch alloy wheels as standard for the top end model, though the Fiesta has to do with full size covers for its 14-inch wheels. Rich black and cream interiors of the Linea greet you on the inside. A lot of attention seems to have been given to the car&rsquo;s interior styling. The lines are harmonious and well balance with the exterior creating a friendly, light filled environment. As far as ergonomics is concerned, the Linea scores high. The multi-functional steering wheel with thumb rests feels great to hold. It comes with controls for music, Blue Me system, etc., but what really gets your attention is the white speedometer console. The Linea has one of the best looking consoles around with loads of info on display. There are two dedicated trip meters, each with average and instantaneous fuel consumption, average speed and distance run. The silver finish central console looks equally appealing, however, look closely and the quality of plastics doesn&rsquo;t feel upto the mark. The music system is quite good and the automatic climate control is easy to operate. Shift action is precise though the ratios are smaller &ndash; more on that later. The armrest is a boon for comfort while cruising on the highway, although it obstructs the hand while changing gears. Vanity lights are also a welcome feature. It is a surprise to see FIAT opting for fabric covers for the seats and door trim instead of leather for the top end version. Though it does give an airy feel, with time, the bright material will be prone to dirt marks. Seating is comfortable up front with impressive leg and knee room.At the rear, the dedicated aircon vents earn brownie points and so does the visor blind. The rear armrest has two cup holders though they feel light and poorly built. One issue bothering me is the car&rsquo;s low roof. Most of us had an issue with sitting upright at the rear. We also found the rear legroom to be slightly on the tighter side for full size adults. The Fiesta&rsquo;s insides in comparison appear opulent. Leather seats do the trick and the quality of the fascia is good too. The steering wheel is meaty and the twin clock speedometer console looks sporty as well. The Fiesta also scores high in space up front as well as at the rear. However, the Optra is the most spacious of the lot here. You do sit a little lower but nonetheless have a great view of the road. The car feels quite wide from the inside and full leather interiors with liberal use of beige impart a luxurious feel. The aircon vents are chromed and clever use of wooden inserts try hard to justify the car&rsquo;s price tag. You can even flip the rear seats to access the boot. There is a rear armrest, though the omission of vanity lights is not welcome. An inte"

"My car is an extension of my personality. I am currently driving the Octavia since last two years now and this has been the longest  have ever kept a car...in last 7 years this is my 5th car...have kept Esteem, Accent, City, Baleno and now Octavia...my experience with the Accent is the worst, since I feel it does not respond to my commands...I feel Octavia and City to be the most responsive cars I have driven and hence my favourite is the Octavia so far.
I aspire to own the BMW M6 and Audi R8 someday and own a hummer...still awaiting the D Day when this dream comes true..until then I am not sitting quiet and working towards owning these beauties.

What else other than an Audi as a dream car. High performance engine coupled with killer looks and way too cool cabin, this is the best that money can buy in this segment. Way to go Audi for the car you have is truly out of this world. Go get them with this killer.......
Audi R8 is a swapan sundri for mostly people . its is acombination of 100 % comfort level + performance level + style  + Fuel Economy  . Audi R8 with some features is like sonay peh suhaga . thats why we all feel that its a aspirational car of india 2009 .
"this car too good 14 speakers,max power,max style,very reputed brand only in 24,00,000lacks.
this audi a4 sedan is great but it takes too much petrol if drown in city.Spare part like mirrors bumpors are too muuch costly.
This car is very safe because it includes features like abs(ebd) ny air bags.
the music system loaded in car is very good i liked this car very much but audi should cut costs.
anyway the car is very good"
The car is like a beam, is only heavy on the looks. In terms of speed and performance  the company could have done better.

Good luxury car for high profile customers......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"The car uses the Volkswagen Group A5 (PQ35) platform of the Volkswagen Golf Mk5, the same as the Volkswagen Tiguan/SEAT Tribu small SUVs. The Q3 slots above the proposed Audi Q2 mini crossover. Compared to the mid-luxury compact Q5 and full-size Q7 which are positioned more for family practicality and off-road performance, the Q3 is aimed as more of a lifestyle/sports automobile. It was launched in the same model year as the BMW X1, a similar competitor.[citation needed]
The Q3 combines a transverse engine layout with flexible steering and suspension offers. The Q3 borrows many Golf Mk5 parts, and also Golf Mk6 parts, components, such as a Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG) dual clutch transmission and a 155 kW (208 hp) 2.0 FSI turbo engine featured in the current Golf GTI.
The vehicle also features a 171 kW (229 hp) 3.0 turbo-diesel V6 and a 210 kW (282 hp) 3.6 FSI V6 for the flagship, the Q3S. While the Q3S is available in both front-wheel drive (FWD), and quattro ""on-demand"" four-wheel drive variants, there is no height-adjustable suspension, lockable differentials or low-range gearing, just larger wheels and a sports suspension.

Wahh!!!...What  a Design it  is. The car in the level of satisfaction is about 92%. But the maintenance is little costly. This Car is won't providing its full strength in Indian Road, Especially Indian Metropolitan cities. But the people enjoying "Luxury" it  is a nice suggestion from my end.
i have not taken drive of audi ,to be honest . but i have a friend in london who always have 100 tounge when taking about audi .because he owns one of them and he love his vehicle very much. he used to force me to buy one of thoe .i also  like audi because of its style .and i have once travelled in a audi ,to say the trurth i feel like any thing because i was feeling the power of the vehicle and even the comfort oh cool and even the smooth sound of the engine .
"You never mistake the rings among all the badges. This car carries a lot of value in terms of its performance and styling. The minus points are its price, 2-seater (well it has to be a 2-seater if its a car like this).

This car looks great and has big time brand value attached to it. This car in its segment can put any car to shame. Terrific handling and a show stopper on the road. Delivers almost all the expectations you hav frm a car. Wud love to
THIS LOOKS LIKE A FANTASTIC CAR WHICH EVERYONE ASPIRES BUT VERY FEW CAN OWN (obviously I cannot own it as of now). LOOKS LIKE A KILLER. THE BEST THING IS TO HEAR THE SOUND OF THE ENGINE ROARING LIKE A TIGER. I HOPE AUDI KEEPS ON MAKING SUCH NICE CARS.

India is one of the emerging car markets in the world. Already some of the top car makers of the world such as Ford, Hyundai, Honda are competing in the Indian car market. Now, there is a new competitor, the Audi A4
MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS CARRRR??? FOR THAT I NEED T ATLEASR SEE THS CAR.
"The first-generation Audi A4 (known internally as the Typ 8D) was debuted by Audi in 1994 on the Volkswagen B5 platform, which it shared with the fourth generation Volkswagen Passat. It had a longitudinal engine and standard front-wheel drive, although many of the A4 owners selected the optional quattro four-wheel drive system. The A4 was initially introduced as a four-door saloon/sedan; the Avant (estate/wagon) arrived a year later.
A wide range of engines were available to European customers, between 1.6 and 2.8 litres, and a 1.9 L Diesel available with VW's VE technology, capable of achieving a 90 or 110 PS (81 kW), although Audi's 2.8 L V6, carried over from the old 80/90 was the only engine option in North America until 1997.
The Audi A4 was the first model in the Volkswagen Group to feature the new 1.8 L 20V motor with five valves per cylinder, based on the unit Audi Sport had developed for their Supertouring race car. A turbocharged version produced 150 PS (110 kW) and 210 Nm (155 ft&middot;lbf.) of torque. This technology was added to the V6 family in 1996, starting with the 2.8 L V6 30V, which now produced 193 PS (142 kW).
Audi also debuted their new Tiptronic transmission on the B5 platform, based on the unit Porsche developed for their 964-generation 911. The transmission is a conventional automatic gearbox with a torque converter, but it offers the driver a choice of driving the car as either a fully automatic operation or with a manual override of the gear ratios."
great car..Dear All,I&rsquo;m driving audi from past almost 5 years. I&rsquo;m putting a review on this site for the first time. My experience has been that Mahindra has experimented and tried to serve...
"You need comfort, power, style, or the latest technology, this car has everthing with it, that is what you call a perfact blend, and that is where you can't stop yourslf  to fall in love with this car, this car has everything one can think of in a car, but only thing which is absent in this car is its economy,if compony wants to improve anything in this car, they must look at its economy and then there will be no car which can be anywhere near to this car.
This car also gives you the status in the society and that is where ones' dream fulfills.
The Audi A4 is the car of my choice in this category above Merc and accord from Honda, because of its value for money, style and power, which can give you extremely comfprtable ride

"Friends,
No words to say. Anybody who aspirs a car would be the R8 in the list of cars given above. th e competing cars would be the M3 or the C63 AMG. But i am sure the COBRA HEAD LAMPS will beat anything of the AMG or the M3. And dont forget AUDI is known for delivering the demanded Hp and torque for you to beat the hell out of MERC AND BMW.
 
just try sitting in the car once!"

Very obviously car is one of the tools which not only facilitate but create confidence inside. So at the time of recession a good economy in fuel with good comforts   style is the only best option. 
With regards   best wishes"
"Nothing much I know about the Car but the brand and looks gives the confidence of being the best of its kind and creates aspiration toward the Car.
I can just dream of Wining it through some lucky drow but not buy it paying it. But Dreams should be made real. rite."

The rear seat is comfy and has best thigh and back support.

"This is one of the awesome car ever driven on Indian roads. AUDI has done a remarkable job in bringing this new trend and generation of Luxury and Class in India. Given the roads in the country, I can say Luxury on Wheels and as comfortable as if u had boarded a flight .
+ points such as
Luxurious and classy, Excellent road grip, Very spacious in the front, rocks on the road on high speeds, amazing looks, power is tremendious, ........................ i can go on and on.."
"This car has everthing in it. 
From luxury,class to comfort. 
But the pricing needs to be revised."
Expensive but good   stylish car.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
only one word for this car is SEXY STYLE.........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"The car is the most stylish and elegant in its class. One of the never before seen in India styling would feed the India market with the toy it has been yearning for. I am awaiting its launch eagerly.
Audi has been scorching the India roads with its powerhouse machines in the last couple of years after its lomg delayed stepping into our markets. The launch of R8 would make its persence impactful."

"
My first actual drive in a Audi R8 was in my gap year, I was there for less than 12  hours but it was enough time for a pricey Audi R8 Driving Experience. I remember  little of the day, beyond spinning out in Audi R8  cabriolet on a wet skid pan,  thinking the Cayenne Turbo was able to operate outside of the accepted laws of  physics, and realising that the Audi R8 Turbo was ungodly fast.
its a verry good looking sporty car with all safety features designed with internationalhatchback style.I AM REALYimpressed with its fuel efficiency andpower packed engine.Its really a charm for small families as per parking and road safety features. Incoming years it will be a great hit on indian roads.
"Exterior The face of the car with those agressive full led lights just stands apart from the E class or BMW5 it is a head turner. The rest of the car is very smooth flowing and a well rounded rear. Side profile is almost coupe like.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Cutting edge technogy with absolute luxury feel. Fit and finish is a1. Highlights are pop up navigation screen, additional lcd screen in instruments cluster, very comfortable seats apart from many other features. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox If you combine the economy of diesel (9-10 kmpl for city   14 for highway) with a pick-up of 0-100 in 6.1sec (for 3 tdi) add to that a suspension which feels like you are floating over pot holes you will get an ultimate driving machine for indian conditions thats what this car is.
Ride Quality   Handling Steering's very light but suspention feels more like an Merc. S class very smooth (Full marks to audi for that). I feel it is perfectly balanced for indian conditions.
Final Words Really really close to perfect.
Areas of improvement Can't ask for much more in the car. But audi needs to price their parts and service little realistically. For eg. the car came with Navigation Hardware but audi wants Rs.96000/- to install the india map software. Way too much for software which should have come pre-loaded in the first place I feel."
"Exterior Its just as good as it gets..led strip increase its dignity.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Easily the best interior in the segment..amazing comfort, super comfy front seat, optional massage seat makes u feel like heaven and it really works unlike some other brands.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is responsive, smooth auto 'box, easily makes speed. However BMW 7 is mOre fun around the corners.but this A8 L has better grip.
Ride Quality   Handling Its just about fine, the ride is comfier than BMW and Jag, but not as good as Benz S, handling is worth praising. Its quite nice
Final Words I say its 1 of the best executive saloon mOney can buy. Definitely a better choice than BMW 7 or Bnez S 2 b unconventional.
Areas of improvement Audi sales and service, the steering is a bit inert and Audi need to do something 2 increase the ground clearance which even suffers at lift mode due to its low nose and very long body."
"Exterior Audi in this car has created a classic. in its second generation now the bold clean lines and proportions of this car make it a future classic. The convertible looks even better than the coupe.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) The interior is beautiful, the stereo is intuitive and accessible. There is more space than u would expect from 2 seater sports car. The seats are great, well bolstered to keep you in place in the hard corners one taken when in this drivers seat.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The 3.2l v6 is adequate though u wish it had a bit more near the red line... fuel economy isnt great but thats not why you buy this car. The dual clutch gear box is unmatched and shifts are smooth and lightning quick.
Ride Quality   Handling Usually, losing the roof effects the stiffness of a car's chassis, so  the ride and handling suffers, or adds extra weight, but not so with the  TT. Most of the bodywork is made from aluminium, making it light yet  strong. This low weight gives the TT amazing agility and,males it very fast in a straight line and grippy  through the bends. The ride is firm, but not excessively so. Despite the  performance, the TT is easy to drive and refined at low speeds. Wind  buffeting isn't really a problem with the roof down.
Final Words Buy it... you wont regret it!"
"The worst car I have ever possessed in the 42 years of my motoring experience. The gear box conked and had to be relpaced by the company. Brake linings are required to be replaced every 11000 to 13000 Kms, and costs you around Rs 40,000/- Service exhorbitant cost. You would be lucky if you dont have to replace the tyres after 15000 to 18000 Kms.
Merely looks are not be looked into a car. I would suggesr buyers of this car to look carefully around and definately look for other cars and definately avoid the audi and Volkswagon cars. Only looks should not the basis to buy a comfortable and luxury car. It would be better for Audi to leave this country as their cars are not suitable for Indian driving conditions as their technology is not in line with the Indian condtions. and not cheat more Indian customers."
"I took delivery of the car from Audi Goa on 25th September 2014, and drove down to Pune. Thereafter, along with my family went to Nagpur. We returned by 25th October, 2014. In one month, I clocked 2647 kms, driven handedly.  I must comment - Service of Audi Goa was excellent and superlative.
Exterior The A6 2.0 TDI Technology car, hass CLASS written in bold all over it. I would rate it second to the Jaguar, but better than the BMW 5 Series and the Merc 250. The external LED lights, are amazing. There is a 3 degree movement, so you can see the turns the moment you turn. While overtaking on a dark road, when you use the upper/ dipper, its like lightning, and you immediately get way to overtake.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) It has the best interiors, and legspace. Beats all the competetion hollow. The Bose Music system with a 6 DVD Changer, a 40 GB built in Juke Box is simply amazing. The built in Navigation system is very accurate. 4 Zone AC is perfect. Interior fit and finish is second to none. The upholstry is brown - Valcona leather, and has an amazing look.  
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Superb engine. There are various modes like comfort/ Dynamic/Individual where you can control the drive quality. This was amazing. On ""Comfort"" I got a maximum mileage of 18.8 Kmpl, between Pune to Nagpur, driving at a reasonable speed of say 120 Kmph. Max speed I was comfortable at was 180 Kmph between Amravati and Nagpur. Because the car was new, I did not have the heart to step on the gas anymore. Pedal Shift Gears are simply superb.  Safety features like 8 airbags, attention assist Stability Controls etc are state of the art.
Ride Quality   Handling The best in the class. My family simply loved it. Drove non stop from Pune to Nagpur in 10 Hours, and it cost me INR 2400.00 for 4 persons and my Pug. Just took a break for lunch for about 45 minutes. Superb handling. Drive it to believe it.
Final Words Too Good. if you want a car in this segment, dont think twice. Nothing less than the Technology, or you will repent. BMW 5 Series 520 D is sluggish and  does not have a spare wheel. Mercedes has a superb ride quality and safety features but the exterior needs to be upgrades, and worst it does not have a navigation system, nor an effective music system. It would be improper to compare the Jaguar, as there are very few service centres accross the country.
Areas of improvement Only the active voice assist system needs some correction. Commands have to be repeated twice or thrice.
The review given above is an individual opinion. I am a Civil Engineer by profession and I am not a qualified car critic. I do not mean to undermine the other vehicles tried by me such as the Mercedes E250, BMW 5 series or the Jaguar. In this segment, all the Cars are very good, but an individual has his right for an opinion, and according to me, I vote for the Audi A6 Technology."
"Exterior
 looks nice
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
 seats are good and comfortable. very bad bluetooth phone integration. searching for phone numbers is tedious. airconditioning is lousy. ok for bangalore but in hotter parts of the country, be ready to get roasted. cup holders badly designed - will not easily hold anything but the standard alu can. extremely poor service response, in timing, knowledge of personnel and not straightforward. unresponsive.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 good, smooth and powerful engine
Ride Quality   Handling
 fair, nothing extraordinary
Final Words
DONT TOUCH IT!!!. i will dump this as soon as i can. my worst buy in 15 years. Merc, BMW, Volvo, Toyota, Honda - tried them all and never had a problem with any of them!
Areas of improvement  
 build quality has to move beyond 'Ambassador' level!
worst is the interaction with Audi people (mine was from Jubiliant Motors), no knowledge of what they are selling and dont live up to any commitment.
 "
"Exterior Looks are good, but high service cost.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Very high body roll, Less leg room in rear and protruded up floor in rear centre, Very less apace to keep the left leg when driving, Very difficult to get in out, Less ground clearance.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Good but very high service cost.
Ride Quality   Handling Bad...Body roll is high, Not comfortable seat for tall drivers, Not comfortable for long drives because of less space to keep the legs comfortably. very low head room. suspention is rugged and thus bumpy. Very less comfort, expescialy for rear seat passengers. Volkswagen manufactures Audi in JETTA platform and they are making money.
Final Words Very high maintenance cost, not value for money. I had driven it 25000kms, fed up and sold it. Not a comfortable car at all.
All these German car makers are just manufacturing cars with same suspension system in India also. But these cars are never good for Indian undulated/ Bumpy road conditions.
Areas of improvement Audi has collect all thses customer feed backs and try to improve it."
"Exterior Exterior combines a sporty look and an elegant feel.. truly well designed.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Very comfortable and spacious, the 4 way climate control, only given in audi, compared in its segment is really very cool and technologically advanced. the engiine is perfected to the core.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox No hiccups in the performance .. runs smooth and vrooms.
Ride Quality   Handling Super light sterring wheel and ultimate cushion shockers make it an awesome ride. air suspension takes away all the pain . 
Final Words  The best buy out there, thrashes the e class and the 5 series. the air suspension option in the car takes it a notch higher and its pick up and smoothness is unmatched. we test drove all three and out of these we though of this as the best buy. e class gave an old feel, 5 series did not show smthng interestng.
Areas of improvement Nothing could be better."
"Exterior Very good - No mention of paint warranty years.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Rear leg room   all head rooms must improve to give inside a spacious feel like Renault duster which is half the cost.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox OK, BUT fuel economy must improve in India   in Indian driving conditions.
Ride Quality   Handling Good but people drive it like touch me not.
Final Words All ""NO"" in features must go, price must reduce, Fuel economy should improve, cost of after sales service needs a lot of attention with Indian customers, No service or sales etc in Agra   after sales service becomes very difficult for owners.
Areas of improvement Features to learn from Mahindra XUV500, Leg room at rear, head room overall to go, Rear camera is not seen, Features need drastic upgradation as seen in Mahindra especially when i am paying more then 20 Lacs for a vehicle - Consider a 3rd row of seats foldable?"
"To begin with, the fact that a globally well established and popular company like Audi has launched such a popular car in the Indian market is by itself a big dream come true for all those die hard car fans in our country.

The car is a major for Audi themselves.Normally you see only the lower end models of globally reputed car manufacturers in 
India.

The Q7 is a bit of a surprise.Its one of Audi's higher range models or at least it cannot be grouped with their lower end models.

The performance of the car is undoubtedly good,especially the 4.2 liter model.But then again  how often do we people get to see cars with capacities more than 3 or 4 liters.

The style is international.Great looks no doubt.

Interiors are well decorated and comes with good safety measures which is the cause of the high pricing.

The cars are only assembled in India.

I am sure that once Audi starts a new plant here we can expect more affordable rates from them."
"Exterior: very nice and beautiful exterior. Gives a look and feel of its big brother Q5   Q7.
 
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort): good but seats feel hard and tiring. 
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox: this is the best feature of Audi. Very responsive engine, excellent gear box   reasonably good milage.
 
Ride Quality   Handling: fantastic. Love to drive. Road handling both off road and soft road is excellent. 
 
Final Words: I tried literally all the SUVs in in 30 lac range but nothing was closer to Audi. Also tried the closest competitor BMW X1 but the ride quality in city wasn't closer to Audi Q3. That's why I stretched my budget. It has the best punchy Engine in this segment. Stability and road handling of Quattro technology is next to none. 
Areas of improvement  
 Seats need to be more comfortable and at least GPS should be included. it has a good MMI interface in which software supports Navigation but do not understand why the hardware has been removed. 
 "
"Exterior
 Exterior is good and amazing looks but they are showing some signs of ageing as nothing has changed over the years. First time when it came it was amazing but now it is kind of ok
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
 Interior also give a vry good feel and touch of luxury
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 The car is full of problems, the engine eats engine oil like crazy and according to Audi this is a feature and not an issue. Gear box has issues. Even features stop working after sometime. One thing or the other gets defective and it keep you running to the workshop. Audi's quality, relaibility is not even 1/10th of Merc or BMW.
Ride Quality   Handling
This is good, if everything works fine, you will enjoy it.
Final Words
 Buy Merc or BMW if you want real value. If you want to see a lower cost upfront but ready to pay installments later in terms of getting car fixed go for it.
 
Areas of improvement  
 
Quality Quality and Quality"
"Exterior
Has a tendency of getting nicks n bruises. Primarily because there are whole lot of corners and bloats at inconvenient places. 
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
 Driver's seat can get very uncomfortable after a while. You cannot see the road in front of the bonnet. Very basic features which are available even on a sub 10 lac car
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Engine is the waek link. In one word - Pathetic. On lower revs you would actually feel as if there is something holding back the vehicle. Gear shifts are good and smooth.
Ride Quality   Handling
 Ride quality is good on even surfaces but on bumpy roads you do miss a hard suspension. Handling is quite un-responsive.
Final Words
 Its a royl disappointment. This brand is taking the Indian Consumer for a ride.
Areas of improvement  
Not much that can be done other than changing the Engine and the Design parameters. Till then Audi is just another good looking car without any substance.
 "
"Exterior Good.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Very nice.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Performace is good.
Ride Quality   Handling Extremly nice
Final Words I will suggest it to everyone who can afford.It has the looks of a big car like mercedes from back, and scoda from the front. Overall design is excellent and so are the interiors.For this price you dont have any better model to compare.
It has the style to go fida. It has the looks of a big car like mercedes from back, and scoda from the front. Overall design is excellent and so are the interiors. For this price you dont have any better model to compare. Honda and Chov is easily 20 to 30% more in cost than ford. Problem comes with the fuel efficiency and if you are fine with 10 km then go for it and dont fall for 12 or 13 which anyone says as i drive very safely and dont go for pickup rides and all i get is 9 to 10 max.
Areas of improvement Cost."

" 
Exterior Quirky.The XC60 and M-Class look more nice.The badge is sporty and posh.Even the boxy Freelander2 can be more good looking.The Bigger Q7 is macho and even a Scorpio or Fortuner look stylish!Audi has great design,mostly for the A4,which I have in silver but the Q5 looks quirky.But the Garnet Red colour looks smart.
 
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Very sporty. Must also get flouresent yellow shades with black and  cocoa brown with beige. Anyway,it is nice and plush.Features list is not bad, but no (Panaromic) Sunroof? Even the i20 has a sunroof.But the Q5 has it as an option, not that bad.The front seats are comfortable. The rear seats are also comfy but the middle lacks comfort,thanks to the high center tunnel like a Vento.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Wind blowing.IT is more powerful than the XC60 and underpowered Freelander2.Only 3.99 kpl by my Q5 now.That is not good.Brilliant typical Audi automatic gearbox.
 
Ride Quality   Handling Ride? It is good.The Q5 can go for travelling off-road.Handling is not nice nor bad.
 
Final Words Bought my Garnet Red Q5 3.0 TDI from Audi Gurgaon dealership on 19th May.It has a temp no.(HR 99 HX TEMP 7901).I like the car,but it has quirky looks,a cramped middle of rear seat and comes at a price.Audi must come out with an upgraded Q5 with a front end by the Audi RS3 and rear end by an Audi A4.I will also get an XC60 later.
 
Areas of improvement Looks need a lot of improvement,the middle in rear seat and the expensive price Tag. These will make the Q5 the choice what the doctor ordered.
 "
"Exterior
 It has the best design of any A4 before or after it. It looks so amazing and you keep starring at it saying ""how is this my car??""
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
 The seats are a little stiff. Quality of materials is brilliant.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 The engine is pretty powerful for the price paid. Acceleration is good. I wish they were sold in india as manual transmission though...there is no feel while driving an auto...
Ride Quality   Handling
 Ride quality is brilliant and the suspension is both soft and sporty at the same time.
Final Words
 The car is the best thing till now. I look up to it....the c class and 3 series dont look as good and dont have the appeal. 4 years and still loving it like its brand new! I really wish i could try the 3.0L Audi S4 because that would be epic. But getting an a4 by itself is a huge thing.
Areas of improvement  
 I wish the car should be priced much lower but the taxes are a big pain. 
 "
"Exterior Very nice exterior thanks to space frame asf it is a car that should be first in its segment bmw is sporty but not attractive merc out dated audi a8 does not have toshout loud to get its atttraction.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) This car can take the luxury car market easily head out.it is spacious and the rear seats its just phenomanal.its first class.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The engines of the Audi A8 is loaded with direct fuel injection and turbo-charging. The diesel variant of the Audi A8 is loaded with 2967 cc 3.0 TDI quattro engine. The powerful engine of the car pumps out 290 PS of highest power at 4850-6500rpm and 550 Nm of peak torque at 1500-3000 rpm. The powerful engines with the help of six-speed tiptronic transmission reaches 0-62 mph mark in 6.1 seconds. Whereas the the higher end Audi A8 4.2L, TFSI petrol variant will take just 5.8 sec. The vehicle can achieve the top speed of 155 mph. In roads of india no need more than this if anyone wants they could go for w12.
Ride Quality   Handling Its very isolated someone people even get headache because of the noisy sounds in india but this car will protect them from happening so.
Final Words Audi India has lifted the covers off its new luxurious sedan, Audi A8 it s the best car to buy tobuy rolls royce for 3.5crore we can buy audi A8.

Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Very good, cautomatic climate control preferred.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Excellent.
Ride Quality   Handling Excellent.
Final Words The vehicle is excellent, however the sales people and after sales service is pathetic. I bought q3 used from Audi Bangalore and even after 4 months still struggling with registration and insurance. They take your money upfront and do not deliver the vehicle for weeks.  The vehicle was fully paid for including Audi Bangalore's charges and yet the registration not completed for 4 months. When you consistently follow up all you get is a bunch of lies. Beware and do not pay up till you get everything on hand. The only thing you get is a cool drink when you enter the showroom and a bunch of petty lies. Audi needs to wake up and take note of this to save their reputation. You have to follow up even for sale receipts and receipts for payments made to them. Extremealy unprofessional.
Areas of improvement Excellent car, bad dealership. Audi, please do something as I would rather buy a Benz or BMW than going to this dealer, though your product is excellent."
This is the worst experience of my life that I have purchased this dead dragon so called prestigious Audi Q5 which has been a nightmare since my purchase. During the previous one month I suffered a lot and my Audi is still there at service station at Sterling vehicle   Gen. Sales, D-4 Sector-8-Noida, India. The engineers over there are such incompetent   barefaced that they are not able to resolve my problem, which is occurring again and again.  I had a horrible experience with the dealer mentioned above because they are charging again and again for the same component which is under warranty.
"Exterior
Looks really great from the outside,Audi has changed their lights from the typical glowing beads to a simpler and gentler looking rectangular pair of xenons
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
Good finish and lots of gadgets to accompany your needs ,u can enjoy the starry sky from the decently wide sunroof,too many led's to help you find your stuff with ease :D,Electronically adjustable seats which is a basic trend with the luxury brands these days,leather seats are standard and really comfortable
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Great throttle response,decent economy, be careful with the acceleration if this your first luxury car because at full throttle the car really jolts forward ,very minimal noise compared to other diesel cars ,Engine is a quattro 2.0 Tdi packed with around 180bhp and 380Nm of torque so feel free to take ur car to a spin in the himalayas  gearbox is a standard electronic one 
Ride Quality   Handling
 handles really well,parking in a stiff place might be an issue for some but park assist guides really well really comfortable ride 
Final Words
Great car for a small family who enjoy a regular  weekend getaway

Final Words Disaster as Audi Q7 Brake Failed: A narrow escape.
I am sharing this incident to make aware all Audi Q7 users. Be safe.
Dear Friends, I am writing this message to alert those of you who drive Audi Q7. Last Thursday, I escaped disaster when my Q7 brakes failed while I was driving. I by Gods grace saved ladies and kids who were on the road. Moved the gear from D to P after which it started to slow down and then stopped.
I reported the incident to Audi dealer. They got the car towed, performed all the tests and told me that the brakes are fine. And they confirmed it through tests and road tests. I know they are hiding the truth because of Audi's image but my conscience is not allowing me to keep quiet and let someone else be the victim of the same situation. By- Mukesh Sharma. 
Areas of improvement Improvge the brake."
"Exterior Good.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Good.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Super.
Ride Quality   Handling Suprt.
Final Words The marketing executives are not open , i have received  2 price list , they claim to give us discount but they are reducing warranty and more importantly i find another person  buying similar car at a lesser price, transperency is not there at all
They also dont disclose the new facelift planned for q3, I have been asking them and they said there is no plans of facelift however in todays paper it says there is a facelift, very confusing, they just want to sell un ethically, they keep their customers in dark.
This is what I feel and it is not a good experience to buy audi at all, we feel cheated. The ride quality is excellent, interior is super, vehicle is goood, however there is no transperency which I feel they need to adapt, else I will not recommend anybody buying this car a t all."
"Exterior Classy and smart, the LEDs look beautiful.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Spacious and the glass roof adds to the charm.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox It runs and how. guess it gave us roughly 13 Kms/litre of mileage.
Ride Quality   Handling Superb ride quality and handling.
Final Words OVERALL EXCELLENT. I can easily recommend it to everyone. Well, as they say, its worth living a Q life!! And it had some road presence man, we got a lot of second glances.
Areas of improvement Nothing much really, its a sleek, smart and young car. Just like the indians today. the steering is ultra smooth and when we went on off-road, the performance matched our expectations well. The tyres gave a good grip, as if they were stuck to the road. yes, it is slightly expensive but if you are an adventurous person, you will feel every penny is worth. Office meetings to Mountains, you can safely take this vehicle anywhere. "
" 
Exterior It carries a dashing personality with strong Audi persona. The lines are smooth and clearly scores over the sharp edges of X3. The rear could have been made a shade less staid.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Interior is spartan but easy on the senses. The dash could have been designed better. The instrument panel is so small that it cannot display all information together- a complicated menu confounds it further. Some of the information are bereft of utility.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The engine performs splendidly and generates feral thrust not expected from a 2 lt engine. The ride is very smooth and scores over X3 and CRV. Gear changes are very smooth and almost unnoticeable. A great performer overall but fails on economy. For a two liter engine consumption is high.
The technicians at Audi garage warn you against taking the vehicle into water with depth submerging half tyre. This puts a big question mark on its offroader capability.
Ride Quality   Handling Ride quality is excellant and floats over the pothole with elan. Handling is superb with hogh fidelity response to the commands.
Final Words It should be bought only as a city vehicle with only limited offroad capabilities. At 100000 dollar price in India it is pooe value for money.
Areas of improvement Dash and instrumentation need quantum facelift. The rear needs to be spruced up to match the strong face. The features should come as a standard package. Simple things like remote boot and fuel tank cover opener should be made standard. Comfort features should not be charged separately."
"Exterior - I bought the Samoa Orange colour. It looks stunning. The day time running lights are attractive and draws attention, 
 
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) - Feels a bit cramped, I expected a bit more spacious interiors. The interiors of my car are Beige and look very sober. There is lighting provided at the right places and it makes the car interior appear like an aircrafts cockpit.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox - I have found that in the city the economy shows about 7 ltrs / 100 km of diesel and on the highways it is about 6 ltrs / 100 kms. The engine is very responsive and the pressure with which the accelerator is pressed determines how quickly the car shifts to higher gear. So far I have found that at 80 km /hr (the max pseed suggested during the running period of 1500 km) the car is in 7th gear. Have tried the 'Sports' mode but found that the gear change is delayed and hence not using it. Have not tried the manual transmission yet.
 
Ride Quality   Handling - Ride quality is comfortable. The handling is good.
 
Final Words - Overall I have got value for the money.
 
Areas of improvement  - The owners instruction book lists many features which are not available in India (park assist, lane change, down hill assist, etc). Audi should print specific booklets for India so that we are not left wondering whether the particular feature is available in the car or not.

Bought a 2015 Audi A3 a little over a month ago. Great car, but having problems with the navigation MMI already. Tells me that the car is somewhere I am not, and doesn't catch the speed traps which all other Audi's do here in Korea. Took it to AUDI KOREA service center twice and they can't figure it out. Basically told me I am out of luck. This is of course AFTER taking my car our for a 44 km joy ride and unplugging the black box so there would be no evidence (expect for my empty gas tank). I just hope Audi Headquarters finds a solution to fix the MMI because the AUDI KOREA dealership and service center are incompetent and horrible. Please hire employees that know how to fix their own products they represent. Audi's brand is being tainted and definitely will not be having repeat customers. Will NEVER recommend an Audi to anyone in Korea. Just horrible customer experience and there are long blogs with complaints from Audi owners. Should have read the blogs before buying. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND REGRETFUL AUDI OWNER!!!
"Exterior Superb looking car.  I have the silver sports package.  Its no Veyron but a good looking car. Sturdy, cute, sporty, and sedanish.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Unbelievable design of the interiors.  Every thing is so perfectly designed like it knows what you are going to do next and what mistake you might make.  I cant list out all the features, its worth one's while to go to the show room and play with all of them.  It will take an hour.  As far as the space is concerned, this is not for being chauffer driven, although if you are the only passenger, the front seat can really move all the way forward and tilt so that you are very comfortable.  Highly comfortable due to:  zero outside sound, superb suspension, perfectly designed seats with just the perfect rigidity of the foam. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is very good.  1.8TFSI leaves you wanting for more at times but the sports mode allows you to enjoy the engine to its fullest.  Even then, I wonder sometimes, why I didnt go in for the 2.0.  Economy is so so.  Gearbox is great.
Ride Quality   Handling Some say that the steering is lifeless.  Not to me.  I find it very comfortable.  It tells me, I am the boss.  True there is low feedback and driver interaction on the steering but I like it.  Ride quality and handling is superb.  It grips the road while driving.  Doesnt jump around like Japanese cars.  When driving, you feel, you know, you experience German engineering.
Final Words For me it was a very close call between the CGI and the A4.  CGI had better power but I am glad I bought the A4 as an entry level self driven sedan.
Areas of improvement  
1. Low front bumper bottom side gets scrapped immediately due to pot holes in India.
2. The music turns on every time the car starts if you have the radio, CD player, and SD card all loaded.
3. Slight lag in power when accelerating."
"Exterior Very well proportioned, clean lines and looks good from almost all angles. The Sun roof also gives the vehicle a very sporty feel. The headlights look very well proportioned and so do the taillights.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Typical Audi interiors, loaded with features. The MMI interface is very tactical to use. The Air con is very powerfull and even with the sun roof, keeps the interior chilled.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Great highway cruiser, very easy to do overtaking, can do some bit of off roading as well. Put the gear in sport mode and the exhaust note changes and the car revs even better. Also, since this a dual clutch 7 speed auto, the gearbox is very responsive. I am getting around 12 Kmpl in city and around 14.5 on highways.
Ride Quality   Handling Ride quality gets better as speed goes up. Size is such that feels compact in city traffic conditions.
Final Words This is the compact SUV for today's young.
Areas of improvement None. Except that the base varient should have been given Auto Aircon as standard factory fitment."
"Exterior Exterior is very good and have edegy feel to it. Though my car is 2008 born, it's styling still make people turn their heads. It's little elongated and curvilinear. You will not find any rough edges and that makes it look very classy. Audi batch itself adds lot of value. It's got raw appeal   enthusiast/common people, both get drawn towards it. Mine is S-line and that makes it look more sporty.  
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Mine being old model is not very rich in features. It does have all the basic techno gadgets but lacks on some. Like it doesn't have bluetooth, USB connectivity, touch screen panel. 
Of all what I wanted the most that this car should have it BOTTLE HOLDERS! Not sure why would Audi not have place to place some water bottle. May be they though that people would always use this car for quick spin in India and none would want to take it for a long drive. We do face lot of problem when we take it out for long drive. Bottles are kept between our legs :-)
Adding on to the list, it would have been great to have some more space in the car. Making 3 adult sit in the back seat could become some challenge (well we can make 3 sit in 800 too but that's not what you would like to do with Audi :-)) 
Having said what it lacks, it does have very comfortable seating. Front seats are better cushioned then a Merc C class.  Fabric used are of great quality   that adds to class feel of the car. Audio quality is exceptional and you start hearing new beats on the same old song.  Steering feel is amazing. Being a hydraulic power steering you need some time to get yourself adjusted to its hardness. Once done, you get amazing road response.  
Overall it's pleasing to sit in the car. But a lot can get improved. Though new model does have some major revamping done.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance is amazing. It get's into life instantly. You just need to press the throttle and adrenaline starts pushing. Greabox is quick but could have been little better. But hey! I am not complaining. This is one of the best cars when it comes to engine performance and gearbox. 
I am getting 8KMPL due to my not so good driving skills :-). If you keep RPM under 2500 I a sure that getting 10KMPL will not be a problem.
Ride Quality   Handling Well here comes that topic that I liked the most :-)   which bring smile on my face. This car drives superbly   manages corners very well. I remember doing Mumbai-Pune on this car and post exit toll towards pune, on express highway, there come sharp right turn. There where gravels on the road and I was not expecting that. I must be cruising @ 90+ and took the turn. I could feel that for fraction of second my car slides and back started throwing itself towards the outer side. But instantly ESP got activates and car was completely under control. This was great! I just saved myself from a major hit!
On one other occasion I deliberately took car on a dirt track and pressed the throttle. Well that was a scene to watch. Buysiders did said later that it jerked like a rocket and took complete control of the road. I had brilliant time driving it for next 20 minute on off track. I was taking corners using handbrakes and car was just sliding. Believe you me, I have driven some good cars but none can come close to what this car exhibited. What character! Loved every bit of it!  
Final Words Good car to drive. Responsive. Stylish. Edgy. Drivers dream. 
What disappointed me the most was dealer support. Guys there is some serious work that Audi need to do with it's dealers. They do have lot to improve upon. My car was sent to them twice and they still could not figure out the the problem. Every time their sales person will call and do pep talk but end of the day work is not done properly. I am in Mumbai and Audi West serviced my car. Their service representative knows only to speak well. Rest, is left to God.  
Areas of improvement Please improve your dealer service. I did thought about changing it as dealers are too bad to work with. May be Audi is not today in a position to do much about it. Such beautiful piece of machinery getting wasted because dealers are not competent enough."
"Exterior-Good exterior with suv look specially 
 the head lamp   new day time running LED light,nice new diamond shape grill,16inch alloy wheel
will add more gound clearance for indian roads and give good stability to vehicle.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)- nice Intreior as good as q5 ,space is little but cannot 
complent as this is entry level compace SUV,Comfort and richness as always in Audi.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Good compace 2 litre diesel engine enough for the car for this size,can give better fuel economy.and automatic gear box can give driving pleasure in traffic.
Ride Quality   Handling
 When it is Audi no one can complent about ride quality,Good for indian road for handling also it has all the goodies such as ABS ,EBD,AIR BAGS to make ride more comforable,Audi have done lots of reasearch before launching the car,and small things also have taken care of.so this will give all the driving fun in city also for long drives
Final Words
 Good package and valur for money can give taugh time to his rivals
Areas of improvement  
 Space could have been more by increasing base lenght or by small boot space
 "
" 
Exterior Its really cool. It has a structure like a limo. The alloys look good when on a drive. But its tough to park in small spaces as it is lengthy. The Ride feels a bit average. It looks elegant. It&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;d love to look at every day and feel happy you bought it. It looks better than the BMW 5 series GT.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) The space and comfort is awesome in A7. The boot space is more but in looks is average. Overall the car's interior features are beyond awesome. Simply Superb! It has more space as comparred to BMW 5 series GT.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Audi has launched the A7 with two engines, both  are 3-litre V6 engines, but one&rsquo;s a diesel with 245bhp and 500Nm of  torque and the other is a supercharged petrol. The petrol makes 296bhp  and can complete the 0-100kmph run in about 5.6 seconds. Top speed as is  with most German cars with performance packed engines, is limited to  250kmph. The A7 on our fuel runs returned just short of 9kmpl in the city and about 14.5kmpl on the highway.
The engine is coupled to a seven-speed dual clutch automatic gearbox.  So, instead of a conventional torque convertor, the &lsquo;box uses two  clutches to speed up the gear shifts. And gear shifts on the A7 in  manual mode, it must be said, are very quick, both while shifting up or  down.
Ride Quality   Handling Yes, the A7 is unbelievably well insulated on the  inside. I have the diesel version of the car here, but unless you sit  at 4000rpm all day, there&rsquo;s hardly any noise that filters through.
It&rsquo;s calm and serene. The same is reflected in  the way the car rides. One doesn&rsquo;t exactly waft in the A7, so one can  feel the suspension working thanks to a hint of jiggle, some muted noise  and tiny bit of vibrations, but the ride is always pliant. It never  gets to you or makes you uncomfortable even when driven in the firmer  Dynamic mode. All the suspension does underneath is remind you that you  have a component that&rsquo;s working, and working well. 
But the best bit for me, has to be the way the A7 handles. It&rsquo;s still  inclined more towards comfort than sportiness, but even so, with the  Quattro system in place, the levels of grip are simply outstanding. So  much so that one can get on the power sooner and harder around a corner,  and instead of getting all nervous, the A7 seems to revel in it. It  also responds to steering inputs with litheness and accuracy.
Final Words It&rsquo;s very difficult to fault the A7. Unlike some  of its competition, it doesn&rsquo;t look quirky and it doesn&rsquo;t try too hard  to be something it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a luxury car that rides well, has  comfortable seats, is easy to drive and live with and is built with  precision. That it handles exceedingly well or has a bomb for a diesel  engine only makes it that much more eligible. It&rsquo;s not perfect, of  course &ndash; the steering, even in the sporty Dynamic mode lacks required  feel and it has a shallow boot, which isn&rsquo;t the most practical. But to  me these shortcomings can easily be overlooked because for what the car  is and what it offers, it&rsquo;s brilliant.
Areas of improvement The Boot space should be improved and the Ride Quality."
"My money down the drains
The Seat are not leather they are leathrite (PVC/PU) which is made of artifical leather (DUPLICATE). Very uncomfortable  to ride on long trips.... you start to sweat behind. HIGH END CAR WITH LEATHERITE SEATS TO CUT COST.
I have purchased the TOP end Technology model Aug 2015.Piece of Shit/scrap product. The maps are over 5 years old (Many highways/National Highways are not vissible). Thanks to Google MAP which navigated me down south temple trip. Navigation is a worthless investment. They took the car to upgrade the MAP   was found that the supplied MAPS was latest. THEY ARE COMING OUT WITH NEW MAPS IN 1 MONTH   AN UPGRADE WOULD COST 25k...
No starts/Stop key.... All small cars nowday has Start/Stop. They show the picture in their Brouchure.
Their Brochure says RSE (Rear screen Entertainment) - AddItional Accessory. I'm reddy to pay 1.75 lacs for this but these guys say this model have discontinued RSE Support in this model. THEN WHY THE HAVE YOU PUBLISHED IN THE BROCHURE.
Service support is horrible. They make promises to break. 
I Did a blunder of my life.... should have picked up a BMW.
The only good thing about the car is Looks, Music system   Ride is smooth."
"Exterior The best looks available in market for this segment as well as one segment higher . the famous audi eyes gives it all for the style and truely is distinguised. has automatic wipers headlight etc almost everthing you want
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Plush interiors full decked up features almost everything you need is there. the seating is a little low so it might be a little stranious getting out of the car. besides that everything is phenomenal.  
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Great economy and amazing perfomence. only after 150k takes time to go to 200. ELSE RIDES SOMMOTHLY AND HAS A GREAT CONTROL.
Ride Quality   Handling Smooth and great handling
Final Words If you are thinking of buying this segment there is no better option... outperfoms bmw and merc by far.  
Areas of improvement Seating in the rear seat. the fuel tank which emerger in the rear sitting are can be lowered down so that the 5th passenger can be seated."
"Bought an Audi A3 - 2.0 TDI Attraction from Audi Bhopal 4 months back.
While the price on road was quoted as 28.5 lakhs in websites I was shown a paper in showroom stating that it costs 30 lakhs. Not knowing that I have to bargain like in a fish market I asked for a discount   was told that I will be given a 1 lakh discount plus additional 50,000 less for doctor's. But only after buying did I know that the showroom was selling it for around 24 - 25 lakhs only.
The sales executive hardly knew anything about the specifications of the car   while I insisted that I want Michelin tyres he said he will try for it but promised me that the car will come with either Michelin, Bridgestone or Continental tyres but was delivered with Dunlop tyres which gets punctured or in fact gets torn in every pothole. After a lot of struggle with them changed it to Continental Premium Contact 5 but this also gets torn with stones   potholes frequently.
To change the torn tyres I have to take it to Indore 200 kms from Bhopal   stay there overnight since the company executive is only interested in closing down the shop sharp at 7:30 PM while the technician who has to change it is not available for the second half of the working monday. And they say in Audi authorised service centre that they have no facilities to repair the puncture but will have to change the tyre only. With all this excellent so called service I would be charged Rs. 19470 for 1 tyre while it costs only Rs. 8500 outside. In fact I changed both front tyres to Michelin for Rs. 9,600 each plus Rs. 400 for wheel balancing while the Audi service centre charges Rs. 5,800 for wheel balancing alone. I failed to understand the logic or maths involved in those calculations.
Exterior A smaller version of any other Audi sedan but with out projector or LED lights.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Rear seat space is really cramped. No rear A/C vent or boot access with hand rest/ cup holder assembly which along with so many other features was (false) promised by the executive as available in Attraction model while we test drived the premium model. Only black interiors available in Attraction with no leather seats. Automatic adjustable seats only for driver. Can't blame the company since I foolishly paid 28.5 lakhs for a 24 lakh car.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox With almost the same engine as Jetta or Octavia, A3 is quicker because it is smaller   lighter with partially Aluminium based body.
Ride Quality   Handling Suspensions are not very soft - not gas filled for a car of this price while my Chevrolet Aveo had gas filled shocks for 7.1 lakhs on road. Bumpy ride with fair ground clearance for this segment. 
Final Words Strictly only for people with black money who can throw money into dust bin - let it be for purchasing or service. Please do not think about it if your money is hard earned.
Areas of improvement With this greedy mindset Audi India has nothing to improve except their mindset. They should close down their operations in India   do some illegal smuggling business so as to earn more money   satisty their money hunger."
" 
Exterior Superbly designed sedan. The body contours are very modern and lines smooth. The front lights are attractive and stand out.
 
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Contemporary, nice, MMI system an offspring from BMW idea but I think still better executed in AUDi. Ease of handling and switching in between sources of media entertainment on wheel.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Outstanding engine quality.
 
Ride Quality   Handling
 
Final Words After my Mercedes C class. This was a way ahead of Mercedes technology, ride quality   value for money. THough not a head turner, I think behind wheel its a fun to ride this vehicle for the sheer joy of drivability, more responsiveness, easy throttle and a reliable German Technology.
 
Areas of improvement Service and care centers are required more and more so that customers like me feel secured from company side. More color options, More technical upgrading options like My Vehicle didnt have those Monitors for rear entertainment. etc.

" 
Exterior The Audi Q7 looks absolutely beautiful. The LED lights, sloping roofline, and overall curved lines make it a true work of art.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Used to own aPorsche Cayenne, but found the Q7 to be more spacious, and more comfrotable on the inside. The wood and leather trim are beautifully done, and the leg room is better than any other luxury SUV. The only drawback is the middle seat in the back can be uncomfortable during longer drives.
The center console interface is extremely easy to use, and so is the voice control function. The ipod interface is also quite handy. Sound system could be better thoug, specially in a car so large.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The 4.2 Diesel engine is extremely powerful yet smooth, and accomodates all driving styles. Even with a lot of passengers and luggage, the car doesn't have any problems accelerating and overtaking. Fuel economy is acceptablefor a vehicle of this size.
Ride Quality   Handling The ride quality is extremely comfrotable. The suspension is soft enough that you don't feel the bumps on the road, but stif enough that it gives a great driving experience. I test drove the BMW X5, Range Rover Sport, and new Cayenne, but found the Q7 to have the best ride quality. It even handles larger bumps and potholes quite easily and is much more nimble than the exterior size suggests.
Final Words If you're looking for a comforatble SUV that can easily handle the Indian road conditions, then look no further. The AUdi Q7 is your car. If you want to do some serious off roading, then maybe you're better off with a Range Rover.
Areas of improvement Sound system needs to be improved. I have the Bose version, and it just doesn't deliver enough power or sound clarity."
"I'm from Chennai   I bought AUDI Q3 in May 2014. My Audi q3 is cobalt blue, Excellent double-shade. I had really tuff-time before deciding on this model. My budget was around 30-35 Lacs. So I had to extend the budget more further and Im happy about it. I was driving Hondy City VT and I wanted to move to Small-SUV as Ground Clearance a Major issue with Honda-City. The options were BMWx1, Volvo v40, Cross-Country, Land-Rover,   Hyundai Santafe(New). I started reading many reviews, watched youtube and after seeing all the cars. I dediced on Audi Q3 and most importantly my 3-yr old son knows all brand of car, his face glows when he see's AUDI on road. I here by sum-up my review about the car.
Good's
The car makes me feel proud and inspires others to buy one.
Drive is excellent. The car is so easy to drive and never makes you feel uncomfortable on any terrain. This is best part of AUDI Q3. Please take a test drive without fear, drive for longer distance, atleast 3-4 KMS to feel the car.
Pick-Up: Excellent!! It Zooms beyond your thinking. It can take you by suprises., S-Drive.(S-for-Suprise) 
Need not worry about mileage.Its pretty decent., 
Bads
There are few basic features which are very necessary and important are missing in Audi Q3. (Key-Less Entry, Reverse Camera, Rear Seat-Arm Rest, Blind-Spot Mirrors). The worst-part is we can not get these done out-side as Audi says &ldquo;there will cancel warranty&rdquo;
Head-Lights, very poor!!! For the speed you drive at high-way, the lights doesn&rsquo;t support and illumination is very less, I wanted to change head-lamps, I&rsquo;m not allowed!! Warranty goes off!!
Seats!!! are very very hard, The cushion inside the leather, needs to be changed!!! After 2-Hours drive, you feel the pain in your back., and no good thigh support in Rear and seats are not very comfortable.
Damn Expensive accessories: a normal cable to connect your iPhone is Rs 7500/. I don&rsquo;t find any reason, how a aux cable can be so expensive, if otherwise the wire is gold-coated. Even other accessories are expensive.________
Still I'm ""Lord of Rings"". "
"Exterior The elegant and sporty plus luxurious looks of the car provide the SUV like feel at a glance The car looks solid and is the true Audi.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Interior and its features just rock and the space is also enough but the hard seats can improve in comfort One feature to brag about the most is the Audi multimedia  others are the various sensors the sunroof etc.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox This is it the 177 bhp with 380 nm torque just make it rove with its awd with a rip speed of 212 nd 0-100 in 8.2 sec this provides impressive mileage to so is a package for drivers The driver would have the perfect experience of power speed and comfort.
Ride Quality   Handling Just awesome.
Final Words If u want the perfect blend of style,looks and performance grab it right now.
Areas of improvement It is perfect but can be better in terms of comfort."
" 
After having done 5000 Kilometers in 2 months after purchase would conclude to have made the right decision to buy the a4 after almost finalising the Beemer  with stunning exterior which is ahead turner wherever you go as compared to the other 2 good cars from germany.
The turbo boost in the sport mode is like a rocket a little less than the 3 series but  that the a 4 can be chipped to 172 bhp awaiting when  Audi starts doing it without affecting the warranty. The best thing is to see the cars disappear in the rear view mirror.
Having driven the octi and the incredible mileage trying to come to terms with the 11 12 kpl avg of the a4 ,the engine is super silent to all other similar cars in its class The 17 inch wheels with the parking package is a must in Indian road conditions The downside, no park assist available as in the passat nor it's available as an after fitment similar is voice mmi control is not available along with navigation something now seen in the ford fiesta.
Audi should enable the remote key for the windows."
"Exterior Dashing looks. Its an eye stopper. Panaromiv sunroof is classic and gives u an extra zeal for the drive.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Awesome interiors. Ambient lighting. Extremely refreshing interiors. fully loaded.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Extreme power.. the pick up is amazing. gearbox is good, fuel economy is around 9kmpl. There is no problem with the engine. The brakes are a mess. The brakes make a lot of noise similar to that of a bus wen applied. The company has no answer to it and they expect you to vacuum your brakes on a daily basis. the company expects this even after spending a hell lot of money on a car.
Ride Quality   Handling Ride quality is good.. its comfortable. Handling is superb. Even at high speeds the handling is amazing. No second thought. Its value for money totally in terms of ride pleasure.
Final Words I will always prefer mercedes ahead of a8 because of poor company response and after sale service.

"Audi R8 look more stylish, dynamic side line is over-smooth, the tail is relatively large, slightly bulky, users said the R8, the rear styling is also very generous, but it feels a little less bulky, may be due to the lack diablo 3 gold of a spoiler's sake, butthe impression is still very practical, very insecure.Audi R8 power is strong, one hundred kilometers acceleration time is shorter, at a high level models of the same level.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Horrid! Try backing the car from stationary state; there is huge lag between the time you press on the accellerator and the time the car starts to move. Engine is a major disappointment till such time the turbo kicks in at around 1.8-2k rpm
Fuel economy will leave you with a smile....
Gear box is the best thing in this vehicle. Grea shifts are beautifully timed without even the slightest lag
Ride Quality   Handling
 Steering feedback is not at all satisfactory. There is hardly any road feedback. Turning and steering movement are not in tandem making it rather uneasy. Strong body roll on curves at speeds above 60 kmph
Final Words
 Once you realize that you are actually paying this kind of money for a Laura (Skoda) engine, the sheen wears off! In fact they have not even bothered to remove the Skoda badging at places..... And heaven help you if you get stuck at one of their Service Centers. You will come out frustrated and feeling cheated. Cannot really go any further on a public forum. Suffice to say that Audi A4 has been a major disappointment for me.

Hopefully, they get honest!

"The hype&rsquo;s over. This is when we find out whether Audi really has built a car to rival Porsche&rsquo;s 911 for the sheer thrill of driving.
So this is it, the moment of truth. The day we discover whether Audi really has managed to build a car capable of beating the 911 at its own game.
We knew the day would come, but I don&rsquo;t think we expected it to come in Las Vegas, Nevada. Land of the endless straight road and Highway Patrol officers who are as proficient with a radar gun as they are with a handgun, it&rsquo;s not the ideal launch venue for a 187mph mid-engined supercar. Or rather it would be if it weren&rsquo;t for the fear of incarceration that sweeps through you every time you prod the throttle.
There&rsquo;s a greater irony attached to launching the R8 in Vegas, but it emerges only after we&rsquo;ve checked in to our hotel. A huge and lavish affair, it&rsquo;s a convincing facsimile of an Italian Renaissance villa. However, when you get up close, it&rsquo;s clear the hotel developer doesn&rsquo;t &lsquo;do&rsquo; flaking grandeur, and it&rsquo;s this perfection, not to mention the replica Pontevecchio complete with obligatory Wedding Chapel, that betray its artificiality. The fact that it also sits on the shores of &lsquo;Lake Las Vegas&rsquo; &ndash; a super-sized Charlie Dimmock-style water feature &ndash; despite being in the middle of the desert only cements the whole sense of unreality. As you soon come to learn in Vegas, nothing is as it seems.
So what of the R8? Will it possess authentic, enthralling dynamics to match the slinky mid-engined styling, or fall foul of Audi&rsquo;s oft-cited lack of passion? More crucially, are we really looking at a genuine, no-excuses alternative to the Porsche 911, or another promising challenger that ultimately falls wide of the mark?
In the cold &ndash; and I mean cold &ndash; light of a near-freezing Nevada morning, the R8 immediately answers one question: namely, does it fulfil the abundant promise of early pre-drive pictures? The answer is an emphatic yes, for the R8 is imposing and supremely aggressive. It&rsquo;s exciting and unconventional too, studded with bold touches and sexy details. There&rsquo;s certainly plenty to take in, and a few things to get used to, but the overriding impression remains one of purity, cohesion and originality. Given Porsche&rsquo;s predilection for unembellished, pebble-smooth and increasingly predictable forms, the R8 really grabs your attention and holds it.
Following time-honoured launch ritual, we&rsquo;re ushered to our car and given a short pre-flight briefing. Unique amongst the launch fleet, our test car is an interesting mixture of standard and optional hardware: standard six-speed manual transmission, cast-iron brakes and gorgeous 19in alloys, supplemented by optional switchable magnetic dampers at &pound;1350 and the &pound;1500 carbonfibre &lsquo;sideblade&rsquo; (the carapace-like panel that sits behind the doors). All the others are fitted with the paddle-shift &lsquo;R tronic&rsquo; transmission, reflecting Audi&rsquo;s expectation that as many as 90 per cent of R8s will come equipped with R tronic. But we&rsquo;re not disappointed to be shifting with a stick; the UK market remains the last bastion of drivers who enjoy the added interaction of changing gear manually.
At &pound;76,725, this manual R8 is way more expensive than a 911 Carrera 4S (&pound;72K), let alone a Carrera S. The &pound;81,925 R tronic version is more closely aligned to the pricing of Aston&rsquo;s V8 Vantage (&pound;82K). While that&rsquo;s to be expected from a product that&rsquo;s hand-built in small numbers (a maximum of 15 cars per day &ndash; that&rsquo;s 3000 per year &ndash; will emerge from the specially constructed block at Audi&rsquo;s Neckarsulm plant) it&rsquo;s disappointing that yet another purported 911 rival strategically sidesteps a genuine head-to-head battle through bullish pricing.
Open the driver&rsquo;s door and the R8 does a great job of justifying the asking price. The driving position is excellent, the sense of space impressive, and the use of contrasting materials and bold design make it the most exciting Audi interior by quite a margin. In fact it&rsquo;s right up there with Aston Martin. The stainless steel pedals, aluminium gearlever and knurled rotary controls shine brightly against the high-gloss piano black centre console and door pulls (these can also be had in optional carbonfibre), creating an exciting, supercar-like environment while retaining the uncompromising quality and logical layout you&rsquo;d expect from an Audi. A Gallardo owner will certainly feel like the poor relation. A 911 owner will weep.
It all comes at a price, though, for another quick glance through the extensive options list reveals that the satnav, Bang   Olufsen stereo, full leather upholstery, Alcantara headlining, hill-hold assist, acoustic parking system, electric heated seats and even the Daytona Grey paint fitted to our car are all cost options, which together add the best part of another &pound;9500. Combine this with the carbon sideblade and magnetic dampers and you&rsquo;re looking at an &pound;88,500 R8. As none of these options is what you&rsquo;d call an extravagant choice (for that you want the &pound;2750 carbon engine cover complete with Pimp My Ride engine bay illumination package) there really is every chance people will be blowing around &pound;100K on fully-loaded R tronic models. That&rsquo;s not just 911 money, that&rsquo;s 911 Turbo money.
So Audi hasn&rsquo;t been shy with the pricing. Question is, can the R8 live up to the 911-beating claims? Settled behind the wheel, and with a hot tip for a great road that&rsquo;s not on the prescribed launch route, it&rsquo;s time to find out.
You start the R8 with a key, rather than with a starter button as you do in the RS4 and even the Q7. This s"

The overall appearance is typical Audi and most design elements are similar to that of the A4 sedan and this includes lights, lines on the side and the stance of the car. Audi says that the new model is a cross between coupe and three-box design. Internationally the car is mainly sold as a hatchback but this model is not expected to be launched in the Indian market.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Classy elegent interiors less spacious in backThis sedan is smaller than the A4, so the space will also be relatively less.

"the best compact sports car out there period!!! nothing comes close nothing. I live in southern California and bought this car in 2006 i wanted an AWD so i went for the quattro(audi calls is quattro for all wheel drive quattro meaning four) mine is a dolphin grey color with sunroof and Mark levinson system you've gotta lsiten to the clarity of the music to believe its genius. the only gripe ive had is that brake pads need to be replaced sooner the reason being that high speeds out here (legal limit is 70miles per hour around 130kms per hour but people usually do 80 or 85mph)
the roar of the turbo and the heated seats, feeling of being pushed back in your seat as it accelerates is something out of this world. the impeecable steering response (no oversteer at all) the tightening of steering (speed sensitive) the cornering  is all too good. the cabin is sound proof and even though the new audi has more sleeker looks i still love mine.
one advice i give to all is that a car needs maintainence and money to maintain so the price will be expensive in India (in rs) even out here the insurance doesnt cover windscreen so if a rock chips ur windscreen and a crack larger than 5 cms develops than one has to replace the windscreen a whopping 700$ expense, if rotors are damaged then 600$ so this can happen with any car out here quality costs money so as long you maintain it it will serve u well if u abuse it you will get nailed!
till date the only issue ive had is with brake pads and nothing else. stay away from jettas they're too problem prone (theyre cheap hence the lure but in the long run u will suffer) go for passat its much more refined      "

"im a current owner of A4 in US and can tell you it makes me excited to go to work and beyond everytime i sit in this car the turbo is just superb what a pick up and the legendary AWD with trip tronic. Audi is the luxury brand of VW it also owns lamborghini well that';s too impractical in India with bad roads and high speed bumps.
from the closing of the door to starting the car to pressing the accelrator its a positive experience
the legendary german craftmanship is the benchmark i almost bought a beemer 3 but nah! audi has more character and looks more aggresive, if it were not the audi id go for the Merc(somehow good for older folks)"
"Now in its second generation and already considered a design classic by many,the TT used to suffer from its image of being a bit of a hairdresser's car.This inspite of the fact that a certain instability  problem at speeds in the first gen car had resulted in the death of many of its young customers especially in europe where the car gained a dubious reputation of being a widow maker!
This was immediatetly  rectified and the oversteer problem was looked into by making the car more front biased which made it safer at high speeds without removing the fun factor thereby making it a car anyone can drive comfortably and fast.
Although trends come and go this is the kind of car you can buy and even drive for as long as you have it without worrying about the newer models being more hep or high tech because like the jaguar e-type,mercedes 300sl and other such cars of yore audi has created a design classic and even after the production run of the tt is over,you can be sure that there will be a market for it and it may become a future classic.
The performance would be nothing short of mind blowing although you should get accustomed to the 4wd system and cornering in such a car at track days before pushing it at the nearest back road or the hills!With the new v6 engine the slight dearth in performance has also been eradicated and most drivers would not complain as it can now be compared with the boxster in terms of performance!
The bottom line for this car is don't look at the 110% customs levied on imported cars when you are buying this beauty because it would leave you with incredible experiences and also be a good investment! "
well, what say about this amazing beauty R8! lovers of audy are incresing day by day in india. and audy is really doing amazing with A4 A8. thing is, we dont have any two seater car in india. and who can afford this its a dream for them to buy R8!.. i dont know what to say about this car because m' speechless. its my dream to purchase a car like this! or any of audy's.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 The audi beats all it's rivals in performance because of it's massively powerful 3.0 V6 engine. The 6 speed automatic transmission is great. There is a choice of V6 or V8 power in the united states. The most basic models get front wheel drive, but most come equipped with the company,s quattro all wheel drive system.

 Audi should improve its ride quality and handling. Audi has already improved in these categories in the new Audi A6.

The looks are flashy and yet understated at the same time, making it a perfect car whether it's a trip to the club at midnight, a golf game or a business meeting.

The uncompromising attention to detail can be seen on every millimetre of the exterior and interior. Lovely, just lovely!"
"This is the dream car. The 2008 Audi R8's unique mechanical layout, high-tech content, everyday drivability, and original style make it an intriguing exotic for those seeking more than just raw performance.
High horsepower and low quarter-mile times are great and all, but in an era when speed comes cheaper than ever, any manufacturer that expects to launch a successful six-figure sports car out of the blue had better bring something unique to the table. The midengine 2008 Audi R8 could be just the thing."
Great car to drive and be driven around a solid Value for Money in this category. It performs really well and is a very stable car at high speeds. The interios are really good and one feels great inside the car. The driving position is excellent and the Automatic makes much better sense for Mumbai traffic even though mileage gets impacted. I get around 7 to 7.5/KM which is OK for a car of this size, but could have been better. The car does lack some key features like Xenon lights and so on for the price one pays.
"Audi A6 is a complete car with its features and comfort its offers expect its breaking. I own an Audi A6 2012 model which i brought in hyderabad, which is 500 km away from where i stay. Everythign is going fine until the hand break use to get struck in the morning and it use to make a ""huncckkk"" sound to release the hand brake like it is breaking the gear box. The breaking system also use to loose itself in uneven surface areas. After the initial service that costs me nearly 19k, i brought the car back home and the next day morning i found that my parking sensors not working. i called the customer care and they asked me to bring the car back but as i stay so much far from the service station, i could go only for the second service. But to my vuneraility, the most disgusting thing is that my second service cost me around 94k butit includes a tyre change. When i went to audi, i felt that the service representative is more like a sales executive who is proposing to get this and that for the car but i refused and just aske dhim to get my secod service done. After 2 days, he called and informed me that the brake pedals needs to change but i asked him why they got weared off so early. he replied saying that it happens for all audi cars that the break pedals wears of for 20k kilometres and gave a tio that it wears off for 17k for audi q7. then i asked him why dont u add this in the 2nd service list for all the cars as the second service is scheduled for 30k kms. and no reply from him. adding to this, they also added the cost for my parking sensors which is their own mistake because i think the service station of audi hyderabad is located in a remote areas where even auto rickshaw ppl refuse to come. and they park all the audi cars outside the service station which more looks like a dumpyard. As an ardent audi fan, i am very much disappointed with their after sales reception. Thanks to Audi for such a reception so that i can recommend any of the friends not to go for Audi.

"I have driven a lot of cars but since I am in one of the most crowded cities in India, its bangalore, so never even thought of buying a car. Personally if I am opinioned then I would say "" four wheels move your body and 2 wheels move your soul"" so I had till now stuck to moving souls only...

Have driven quite a lot of cars though, wagon r, audi, civic, accord, lancer, getz, swift, dzire and a hell lot other... If personally asked I would say I liked the driving experience in scorpio, sx4 & dzire...

My ultimate dream car would be the american muscle ""ford mustang GTR 1969-Shelby ""... thats a car you can mate with :)

But for now I am planning to buy a car in near future & lukin out for mini-cooper to be launched in india. I have driven that in UK and man its awesome..."
"Areas of improvement  I was a proud owner of A6 till few weeks back. I am completely uprooted to know my vehicle simply walks in the workshop to get serviced, ( Last week of November, 27th) its Engine control panel is been updated and I am told after making several enquires that it is konked off. To top it all, neither local Nagpur team, nor Mumbai team is able to take care of the problem. Probably German team was called too but they have also raised their arms up. Now I am been told the part is going to come from Germany. An Engine Control Panel ! Not available in India ???? I am loosing faith. Can someone restore it? Michael Perschke / Jessica Geutner are you hearing?
Then after a week, the local Nagpur team calles in only to pacify me sadly and could not convince me to a great extent.
My issue is  : If I am putting in so much money to go for a ""BRAND"" called AUDI A6 ...I should get a complete mental satisfaction, comfort, pleasure, backup service, machine reliability. Here, The basic is only going wrong...Its coming to a major technical fault which nobody in India and Germany could handle so, the easy scape goat solution of replacing the part itself, which was at fault.
This make me completely uncertain on the machine and the brand.
I am still not bringing in the issue of my Octroi money been taken , not been put in by a company official of Audi. The case of which is still pending in High court , Nagpur Municipal Corporation against Audi. Our names were flashed in newspapers and dishonored. Because of a staff in AUDI , who eloped with money and then behind bars, my name was flashed . Why should I not file a suit of defamation.
And now AUDI strikes again , this time with a mechanical, manufacturing , technical failure !!! Not expected at all.
Mr Samrat Sinha, keeps on buying time to give me a good offer, which after some nagging came to fore today, brought in by Local Nagpur dealer. They want me to trade in my car for 25 lakhs and put in more money If I want another vehicle in return. And ho much money are they asking. A whooping 26 lakhs!!!
A professional, a Doctor, who all his life dreamed about a luxury car, and ultimately bought it in the form of A6, cannot afford this jolt. Neither financially, nor sentimentally. I am approaching you so you will help me putting this in media so more people don&rsquo;t fall prey to this foreign companies coming to India, making false promises of servicing and failing which, forget courtsey but try and hit another business deal. I hope I will get justice here.

"Exterior Is to perfection with a size of a baby SUV and bulk of a roadstar with splendour rocking all around the car the car being light almost like a city car is also a powerful off roader.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) The features are to perfection with sunroof and Audi mmi screen making this car a tempt while space is fine for 5 and the support is good as well but the seats are a bit hard.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox This small 2 l motor maY sound u quite but u will be totally ashtonished to hear that it produces a powerfully 177 hp and 380 nm torque and zooms 0-100 in just 8 sec and top speed at 212 while the duel economy is adequete and the 7 speed stronic gearbox is as good as always.
Ride Quality   Handling The car is refined and light so is fun to drive and a tempt to handle.
Final Words Just a package.
Areas of improvement The seat should be a bit comfy."
"Exterior
19"" 10-Y-spoke alloy wheels.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
The new technologies include a night vision assist with marking of detected pedestrians, the Audi pre-sense safety system, as well as a speed limit display. A8 trumps its European rivals for interior decor, standard AWD.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
The 372 horsepower unit also promises reduced fuel consumption by 15 percent.Strong enough from any speed, an Audi A8 L accelerated to 60 mph in 6.6 seconds, just a bit short of Audi's claim of 6.3-second 0-60 mph time.That is good.
Ride Quality   Handling
Manual gear selection is available via steering wheel rockers or by using the regular gear selection lever.It has a good handling.Optional 19-inch tires do little to enhance control. Strong braking is a benefit.
Final Words
Thereby i say that this car is cool and more reliable than many other cars but a few little changes could be made to enhance the performance and the reliability of the car.
Areas of improvement  
 
The seating capacity could be made more that is at least about 8 because of the high price if not the price could be slightly decreased so that many people can afford to buy it."
i do not own this car. but have fantassy for the same after viewing the car ad in t.v and motor cars magazine. hence it is my fantassy car. i wish this car should and must be voted the best by all .                                                                  
This car is awesome and a pleasure to  own it and be the envy of all.The most exhiliarating experience and sheer pleasure of driving makes it the perfect car to posess in ones stable.Audi has always ben able to offer the best product to people and is known to think out of the box.The performance for the price is just amazing.I would even go to the length of stating that if one cant own a ferrari or a porsche then one can definitely go in for a Audi and yet not lose out on the feeling.
its bakwassssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Think twice you buy this. It's not one of the cars which you love it on roads, it pure showroom piece.. want one contact  me. ----------------------------------------------------------------------
when i decided to replace my mercedes, there were three cars in my mind BMW, Rolls Royas and Bentley. I had a test drive of these three cars. Now BMW i found latest one but it is owned by a number of persos. I ready to spent upto 5 crore to get a unique car which matches with my enterprenurial image.Finally i decided to go far Bentley. It has all the features of a car, a perfect car meant for royal persons.Its has a great pick and amazing power. When i drive it on highways, it moves like a ship moving over highseas.Interiors are dam classy and its outlook is also satisfactory. However it needs some upgradation seeing its prizing. Now  a days, so many cars of very sofisticated look is coming in market at cheaper prises, and a normal customer looks prises first.....................................well its overall a status symbol for me

 Most automobiles in use today are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by deflagration of gasoline (also known as petrol) or diesel. Both fuels are known to cause air pollution and are also blamed for contributing to climate change and global warming.[28] Rapidly increasing oil prices, concerns about oil dependence, tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for automobiles. Efforts to improve or replace existing technologies include the development of hybrid vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles. Vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries.

Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle or automobile in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle.[13] He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army, one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts.[14] His inventions were however handicapped by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure.[14] In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods, and was of little practical use.
 
In 1807 Nic&eacute;phore Ni&eacute;pce and his brother Claude probably created the world's first internal combustion engine which they called a Pyr&eacute;olophore, but they chose to install it in a boat on the river Saone in France.[15] Coincidentally, in 1807 the Swiss inventor Fran&ccedil;ois Isaac de Rivaz designed his own 'de Rivaz internal combustion engine' and used it to develop the world's first vehicle to be powered by such an engine. The Ni&eacute;pces' Pyr&eacute;olophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder (dried spores of the Lycopodium plant), finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.[15] Neither design was very successful, as was the case with others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, and Etienne Lenoir with his hippomobile, who each produced vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by clumsy internal combustion engines.[

An automobile, autocar, motor car or car is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transporting passengers, which also carries its own engine or motor. Most definitions of the term specify that automobiles are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods.[3]
The year 1886 is regarded the year of birth of the modern automobile - with the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, by German inventor Carl Benz. Motorized wagons soon replaced animal-drafted carriages, especially after automobiles became affordable for many people when the Ford Model T was introduced in 1908.
The term motorcar has formerly also been used in the context of electrified rail systems to denote a car which functions as a small locomotive but also provides space for passengers and baggage. These locomotive cars were often used on suburban routes by both interurban and intercity railroad systems.[4]
It was estimated in 2010 that the number of automobiles had risen to over 1 billion vehicles, up from the 500 million of 1986.[5] The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China, India and other NICs.[6]

Be objective and truthful. Tell us how you really feel. The useful reviews include not only whether you liked or disliked Vehicle, but also why. Feel free to mention related items and how this car rates in comparison to them.Be detailed and specific:
" 
Exterior Very stylish front end,large grills,elegant design and, curves are literally seamless. Bentley rims really bring more bold look for the car and whats really nice is the independent Bentley logo on the rim. The rear end of the car is a bit auckward as it cuts away at some places.Headlights are very effective in lighting up the road and makes you very confident.Overall, a very rich look.The exterior gives the an option even choosing the soft lines colour.
 
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Interiors have two options of 4 seats or 5 seats.The 4 seat option gives the rear seats a centre console.Bentley fortunately gives a lot of customisable options on the interior right from the seats to the very minute chrome lines on the waist line if the door.Loads of features including the awesome NIAM audio system. More of features available in bentleymotors.com
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is very refined but not very quite.In many being a bit noisy makes it more sporty. It has a 552 hp ,6 litre twin turbo, V12 engine, PHEW! The figures might make you think its a monster and is very very fast.Bentley infact has the most compact V12 engine and very rigid body making it heavy reducing its power to weight ratio.Still it manages to reach 100kmph within 5 seconds! with a top speed of 312 kmph.There is also comfort and sports mode available. The gearbox is smooth and fast and responsive.
 
Ride Quality   Handling It is a very confident car, even on the most extreme weathers due its safety technology.
 
Final Words Bentley is the best luxury car on roads. It has great performance and safety,and is very comfortable and sporty even for a family.
 
Areas of improvement I would suggest Bentley to reduce weight somehow so that they can reduce engine size and increase fuel economy.

The bentley mulsanne is the car that  one should just have its ext. is just great. It just looks like an searing eagle. It is a wonderful experience to have this car.
Its comfort is such that it can beat a Rolls-Royce or any other in any segment. Its engine is the smoothest and the most responsive. It has a refined engine. But it has a bad fuel economy and the price. Whatever is the price but its worth a buy.
 
The fuel economy can take you by storm you need a lot of money to take care of it. The gearbox is great and the engine has no noise and their is no turbo-lag. Its safe and safest. Better than a Ferrari.
Once I went to Chandigarh. The comfort it gave was incredible their was no noise and gave us a good sleep. The boot is huge it gave us lot of room to keep our luggage as we were going to Chd and then to Amritsar. When we stopped at a restaurant. A crowd gathered around the car. It was a pleasant travel thanks to mulsanne.
 "
" 
Exterior It has got a outstanding style with a royal look.
 
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) It is a car with hi-tech features and with lots and lots of comfort but it's not so spacious.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The car has got a power hunk engine and great gearbox but with not so good fuel economy.
 
Ride Quality   Handling Ride quality and handling of car is like butter on a heated pan.It is very very smooth.
 
Final Words My final words for the car is that it is a dream car of every man with royal looks, if you go out on roads with this car with your wife or girlfriend I guarantee there will be thousands of jealous eyes.   It has got a power hunk engine and great handling but with not so good fuel economy and the car is not so spacious.
 
Areas of improvement As I have mentioned that car is not so spacious but if they will make it spacious then it would take away that outstanding look.it has not got a good fuel economy and in that area it can be improved a lot.

"Exterior
 the exterior is very nice.It has been beautifully made without any problems.One cannot doubt bentley's quality and moreover it is one of their best cars which they have ever made.The fit and finish of the bentley's exterior is outstanding.Everything, from the logo of bentley to the head lamps and the tail lamps are truly BENTLEY
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
 the interiors feel really plush and comfortable. It looks beautiful too. Besides it is very practical also . The space though is a big issue. Even though it has a pretty roomy boot,the space in the rear is a big trouble. The car can barely seat 4 people. That means it will not be the best option to buy in india considering the  fact that people usually go out in a car with the family.The next criteria is comfort where it scores hugely again. It still makes it a descently practical car to buy in the country. The seats are really comfortable nad supportive
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 the performance is outstanding for a car that is so heavy and luxurious.Its top speed and acceleration is mind bending. 0-100 km/h in about 4.5 secs and a top speed of nearly 320 km/h which makes it really fast.The economy is descent but still it needs to be improved considering the steep prices of petrol in india.the 6 speed automatic transmission is a boon to use
Ride Quality   Handling
 excellent ride quality and handling
Final Words
 this is truly a car of perfection . It is definitely a thing to flaunt . But you can only buy it if you are a multi-millionare
Areas of improvement  
 the fuel economy and space are the only areas which require improvement to make itself emerge as a benchmark in luxury automobile

I got this car in Feb 08 and I love everything about it. It is a driver's car as well as a passenger's car.  Its very comfortable and extremely smooth drive. It's got ton's of gadgets and gizmos!! ( i am still trying to figure out some features).
"Exterior
 the worst exterior ever. it looks like a white elephant and behaves like one to.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
 it is not at all spacious in terms of the bmw tag. it does not have enough features to go with its segment. it is the mmost emptiest vehicle in its segment.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox 
 not good at all as it can pick its weight while climbing up. it is a bad car in terms of the fuel economy. it consumes massive litres of petrol.
Ride Quality   Handling
 this car is very wobbly and cannot handle itself in hilly areas.
Final Words
 Try not buy this car as it consumes gallons of petrol in one or two drives.
if you buy this car you will be left with no money, take my words.you will be saved. 
Areas of improvement  
 it has to improve in all ways, specially the fuel economy.

"Hey    
 Does other people love BMW's just like me?    
This past May, I bought a used BMW Z3 roadster, and entirely love it. BMW is actually one of the best brand name vehicles you can buy. I am going to always purchase BMW's from now on, however I still must say I like the older design much better than the new models. The old designs (really anything from 03,04 in some models back) look real german. The newer ones look more like japan makes, but nevertheless, they are simply remarkable.     
 Cheers     
 John"

I just purchased a family car and I have no idea which car insurance company is great as well as has great discounts. Can anybody help me? Take into account I'm within a strict budget. Does any one know which is a good company in my situation?
Want suggestions from professional in auto insurane.   I know a number people who have given their personal details to one of the numerous "online automobile insurance quotes" and today they've solicitors all over them, emails, on their phone, junk postal mail as well as one case of Social Security Id theft.   Therefore my question is: Are these online car insurance quotes honestly safe?   Doesn't it seem appropriate to stay with a local auto insurance agent you can do business with either over the phone or perhaps in person.

 BMW A BIG NO
It was in the month of April 2011, when we decided to purchase a new vehicle and was confused between BMW 520 D, AUDI A6 and MERCEDES E 220. It was during this exercise that the BMW representative impressed me with its features and USP&rsquo;s.  Bowled over and without further thought I chose the BMW 520 D and was happy and proud of my prized possession blissfully   unaware of what was in the offing.                               
Unfortunately my happiness was short lived. Frequent outages have eroded my trust in the BMW and I can&rsquo;t even dare to dream of traveling in it for long journeys. I am pained to write this article and bring general public to notice the following incidences which have cast a doubt on the decision of owning a BMW:
* In February 2013, the &ldquo;BMW &ndash; 5 SERIES&rdquo; broke down and the engine would not start. The vehicle was crane lifted and came back only after 8 days. The problem reported was that the fuel pump of the car was burnt due to some technical problem.
* In March 2013, one of the tyres of the &ldquo;BMW &ndash; 5 SERIES&rdquo; busted. Again the vehicle was crane lifted and came back only after 6 days. More over to our surprise there was no indication on the screen about the tyre being busted. We only realized it when people driving along the same road indicated to us.
* In May 2013, the brand new tyre (which got replaced in march 2013) of the &ldquo;BMW &ndash; 5 SERIES&rdquo; busted. Again the vehicle was crane lifted and came back only after 7 days. This time there was an indication on the screen about loss of air pressure.                                                                                        
* In July 2013, the vehicle was again crane lifted because &ldquo;BMW &ndash; 5 SERIES&rdquo; once again broke down in the middle of the road leaving me stranded for more than 4 hours.  This time my BMW520D was gone forever. Its been more than 7 months now and my car is still at the Deutsche Motoren workshop, Faridabad. The problem detected was some hydrostatic lock due to which the engine fails to start and needs replacement of some parts. Every time I inquired about the status of my vehicle, I was told that the company here in INDIA is awaiting some parts to arrive from GERMANY and as soon as they receive the parts, the vehicle would be restored to series standards.  But 7 months&hellip;.. is it really worth it. Can you give me one good reason to buy a BMW, spend so much money, only to experience it gone for months because it rained? Does that mean that BMW is producing seasonal and regional vehicles and it is the responsibility of the &lsquo;so called proud owner&rsquo; to make sure that he doesn't use the vehicle during the MONSOON SEASON as well as on the road(s) which are not leveled properly.We have contacted the company several times via emails or over telephone and every time the company has shifted the blame of the vehicle&rsquo;s malfunctioning back on us. I had bought a BMW with the expectation of high dependability and reliability however I find my expectations have been unfortunately proved otherwise as can be seen from the above.
In all the incidences quoted above I could not keep my scheduled engagements and not only suffered financially but also in terms of credibility. Ironically I had chosen to travel in a BMW for these engagements as I was under the impression that this car would not let me down however these experiences in a short span have shattered my faith in BMW and I feel miserably cheated and let down. For any clarification or further information, please feel free to get in touch with us @ ksinghal18@gmail.com"
fantastic car..pricey due to import duty structure in India. Spare tyres not easily available. expensive to run. performance is great comparable to Base Carrera 911. makes heads turn. More stylish than 5 series.                         
I had a lot of expectations from the 530d.. My brother wanted to buy the Bimmer so i went along with him.. Starting from the salesmen to the handling of the car, everything was disappointing.. I wish to register a formal complaint against then but stooping down to their level is something that i don't intend to do... We walked out of the showroom and went back home... The next day we went to T&T Motors, Gurgaon and their staff was so pleasant with us... It was such a refreshing change.. The E350 was such a change.. From the ride quality to the handling character and from the interiors to the distinct exterior features of the car, everything was perfect.. He will be getting his car delivered soon...

Your vehicle BMW 735 li  with my Chairman (Dr.Sri L.Rathaiah Garu Chairman of Lavu Educational Society in Andhra pradesh) - - is frequently giving trouble. Earlier three times the vehicle failed on the middle of the road causing severe embarrassment. So far it has covered only 90,000 kms only during the last 5 years and so far the cost of repairs has exceeded Rs.10 lakhs. Again on Date:- 19 Nov the BMW vehicle of  the Chairman Lavu Educational Society failed on the middle of the road indicating transmision failure. The Chairman had to get down on the middle of the road and had to find another vehicle to meet his appointment. This break down on the middle of the road was immediately after the vehicle was called back for replacement of some break parts. This has annoyed the Chairman too much.
Having spent Rs.80 lakhs or so for its purchase this kind of frequent failures and this magnitude of cost of repairs is beyond any reasonable justification and this is certainly causing serious disappointment to the Chairman Dr.Sri.L.Rathaiah Garu of M/s.Lavu Educational Society Andhra Pradesh (which has a very wide network of Educational Institutions throughout Andhra Pradesh, and which has about 50 thousand students on rolls, and which has 8 Engg.Colleges and 40 odd Junior Colleges   Schools )
This vehicle is being looked after for maintenance at M/S.KUN, at RTC Cross Roads at Hyderabad Andhra Pradesh. Mr.Methi Ram Rajasekhar is the Service Manager and Mr.Ashvin Kumar is the General Manager. This exorbitant  cost of repairs and frequent failures was brought to their notice  personally by the Director (Transport) of M/S.Lavu Educational Society on the day when the BMW car was handed over when the car was recalled for some break part replacement.
Now again in addition to about Rs.10 lakhs of cost of repairs earlier so far, now for transmision failure the estimate demand is for about Rs.2 lakhs which is neither reasonable nor justifies the prestige of the company of the fame of M/s. BMW from which the car was bought for Rs.80 lakhs some 5 years ago. For a mere 90,000 kilometers already Rs.10 lakhs spent and another Rs.2 lakhs estimated is beyond any reasonable and logical justification. 
It is high time that BMW Company looks into the specific problems of our BMW vehicle of 735 LI Model. This is because of the high cost of repairs already incurred and frequent failures on the middle of the roads causing severe embarrassment to the Chairman of the Lavu Educational Society Dr.Sri L.Rathaiah Garu.
It may please be noted that the promise made at the time of sale about the ""almost cost free operations"" is not kept up by M/s. BMW.

"Exterior: Classic Car for Indian Roads, will continue many many more years, Villagers Showed more Love for Amby then Optra, Toyota, Honda ext.
 
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Comfortable seating on the front as well as back, lots of leg space so tall persons like me have No problem during driving by self or enjoying journey at back seat. Boot space is so much that  a family of 4 can store 3 months of food.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox   Engine Highly vibrate above 100KM speed, Fuel consumption as per BS III, One full tank of fuel gives lots of relief while driving on highways.
 
Ride Quality   Handling- Breaking system needs improvement with ABS, Exhaust pipe shakes in high speed, needs twin silencer to reduce bad noise. Rough engine sound steals comfort ness while driving in high speed (above 100 KM).
 
Final Words - I came to India from UK to experience her beauty   heritage. I was told by my Grand Father Now (92yrs)- ""If you want to really explore Indian heritage then I must have an Amby to complete my wish.""  Last 10 months I am visiting several places within India, one  after another with my wife   son with a professional driver . This Sky Blue Amby with captains' cap is so reliable that not  even a single time we have faced any type of vehicle related problem. I salute its reliability, all 3 after sales service was furnished outside New Delhi without any delay by other Amby dealers. Now we are so attached to this Car, my wife   kid is forcing me to take the car at UK. This car receives ample respect on the Indian roads, that might be because of its aristocratic outlook. 
Areas of improvement  Breaking System, Vibration, Noise control at high speed, Increase of wheel breadth will provide more stability on highways."

The car is Value for the money i don't think any one would ask for something more than this in a car. One of the most stylish car in its segment, superb performance, Comfort at its best and overall a Excellent driving experience. I would request people to Test Drive this car before they plan to buy any other car in this segment because once you feel the drive of this car i am sure you would not even think of checking the competitors. 
I think this is one of mine dream cars. It has a stylish look, good luxury feel.It is fuel efficient as has been said in your detailed comments. I think its a good car to match with my status.The performance of the car is also very good   it is a good value for my money.
I got the 530d a month ago and it's probably the best BMW I've owned. I've had the 2004 - 530i and the 325i before this. I have to say that this is the best BMW has made. The right balance of performance, luxury and price. BMW had a year ending sale and I got a mind boggling deal.
Having been driving the BMW X5 3.0(Petrol) - 2009 SUV for the last few days, I say from personal experience that it is difficult to find a better vehicle which has all the fantastic characteristics that one would desire in a upmarket SUV including a decent mileage which is hard to come by on most pertol guzzling SUVs now a days.

"Cyclical redesigns of cars are usually accepted and often celebrated.
The team for BMW's
3-series, on the other hand, can't so much as pick up a pencil without the
automotive community throwing fits. To us enthusiasts, the passing of such a
sublime, rewarding machine is like a dear friend getting cruelly swept away
from our suddenly emptier lives. Besides, what's the point? When you stand at
the top, movement means descent - anyone notice some descension with BMW's
newer designs? - and believe you me, the 3-series was at the top.

But everyone wants something new, and this car is serious
business (as in half-of-BMW's-worldwide-sales serious) so another seven years
brings another 3. If the changes aren't drastic (visually or otherwise), some
rank as newsworthy. The first - perhaps you saw this coming - is that this
fifth-generation 3-series is longer, wider, and taller than before, making some
room for both passengers and the smaller 2-series rumored to be on its way
over. There have been minor suspension upgrades, changes to both the engine
roster and the engines themselves, and BMW threw all of its latest toys -
Active Steering, DVD navigation, and yes, iDrive - into the playpen.I believ its catalytics is as good as my Merkur catalytic converter, there'd be no doubt 'bout it...

"Better known than its narrowly focused predecessor, the E36 M3 was based on the then-current  E36 3 Series. Making its US debut for 1995, this M3 had a mission beyond  BMW M&rsquo;s usual dedication to great performance and handling: to bring  BMW M and its great driving machines to a wider spectrum of U.S. buyers.
With over four hundred horsepower, the E92 M3 sees the first time regular production 's will come with a V8.  Along with the usual M magic worked on the E92 3 series platform and design, it will come with a 7spd M-DCT with Drivelogic to harness the new power and torque.

BMW M3 is best car ..........its evry bod dream to have it ............................................and so confort to ride also.......................................................................................................................
iT IS ACOSTLY CAR AND BEYOND CAPACITY OF PURCHASING THE SIAD CAR OF 90% OF THE POPULATION. oVERALL THE CAR IS VERY GOOD WITH OVERALL GOOD LOOKING, GOOD EXTERIORS AND INTERIORS, VERY COMFORTABLE. tHE DEMARIT OF THIS CAR IS LESS FUEL EFFICIENT.
"i like it tooooooooooooooooooooooo much.i am greatly satisfied with it's fuel economy and performance.but i didn't like the exterior too much.BUT IT IS GREAT IN INTERIOR,FUEL ECONOMY,PERFORMANCE.THE automatic transmission is also very good.if it have GPRS SYSTem in the top model  it will be great.

The BMW M3 is a high performance BMW M GmbH version of the popular BMW 3-Series compact automobile. M3 models have been derived from the E30, E36, E46 and E90/E92/E93 3-series. Common upgrades over the "standard" 3-Series automobiles include more powerful and responsive (yet at times smaller) engines, improved handling/suspension, more aggressive aerodynamics/body, and multiple interior/exterior accents with the "M"/Motorsport nomenclature.
"The best car i have seen in this category. it feels like you are flying, there is no jerks on top speeds of 200plus KM/hr. Awesome look, made to the perfection. Has good power and technology. The safety is very good, pick up and fuel economy is best in its calss.
Will prefer BMW as this is better than Mercedes and Audi in Looks and performance."
The car must have fuel efficiency and when you sit in the car you should feel confort and give pleasure. As BMW is one of the most reputed company in Erope and most of the rich people are using this car. It has also a world class engine and it is accepted by all over the world africa, europe, asia and Ameriaca Canada etc.

Futuristic look and really a trend setter. The car would definitely revolutionise the Indian roads. It suits to the youngsters' aspiration and speed craze. The look reminds a fighter plane. It appears that it would provide ample safety to its passengers also. It looks an innevitable temptation and an ultimate objective for the car lovers.
"u wont believe ti.  it has got everything u can dream of . it has got excellent looks.  its performance is too good. sitting comfort is very good.  very good on road performance.
its ultimate in driving and for outing also."

"So far I have only driven a BMW M5 in 1992 when I was studying in London.
At that time I also had chance to try out a Merc s class and some sporty models of english cars like vauxhall and jaguar. My experience is that what BMW packs in a M class sedan is better than anything any other carmaker can do."
Best suited for executive class category.Its really cozy and comfortable to drive this car.The looks are really eye catching.In my opinion BMW stands for Bade Makaan Walon ke liye. He he he!Its terrific . Its not in my reach now so I cannot afford to experience it . But still it is a best suited car for the people who loves driving.

 Does other people love BMW's just as much as me?    
This past May, I bought a used BMW Z3 roadster, and totally love it. BMW is seriously one of the best manufacturer automobiles you can get. I most certainly will always buy BMW's from now on, however I still must say I love the old design a lot better than the newer models. The older versions (really anything from 03,04 in some models back) look real german. The newer versions look a lot more like japan makes, but nevertheless, they are simply remarkable.

This Car is for pure enthusiasts with fat purse.  But the driving pleasure you get is very good.  BMW Cars are always Driver's Cars.  They put lot of research into Performance and Driver Comfort.  For Indian conditions, the run flat tyres may not suit.  And the 97 Octane Petrol availability is limited to only Big Cities.

On a vehicle like this, a powerful display of strength is everything. The sculpted front of the BMW M3 Convertible makes no secret of the tremendous power that lies in wait beneath the bonnet. While classic M styling, such as the M gills and chrome-plated steel twin exhaust pipes, helps underline its dynamic presence and elegance. Only the interplay of these measures ensures the desired effect: sports car performance that is ideally suited to everyday driving.

I never Touched this Car But I very Much like its Style I thing it is car which stands apart you from croud. it is true Dream full filling Car.Only No. of dealers are limited. Service Network Shoud Expanded to hold business in Huge Country like India there is much more potential in country what BMW thinks.
PRSENTLY NONE OF THE MANUFACTURERS HAVE UNDERGONE ALL THE PARAMETERS WHICH I FEEL WILL BE CAR OF INDIA AND INDIANS WOULD LOVE TO DRIVE AND REACH THE LEVEL WHERE FORIEGN CARS WILL NOT HAVE ANY STAND ANYMORE IN INDIA.LET ALL OUR TOP MANUFACTURERS JOIN HANDS AND BOOST INDIAN CARS WITH GOOD PARAMETERS AND SEE THE CHANGES IN THE CUSTOMER ATTITUDES TOWARDS OUR CAR PRODUCERS.
This car has justified fully, the decision, I made in buying the same. It has lived upto my expectation in terms of style, comfort, safety and utility. The comfort is no less than the one, as if you are in the comfort of your drawing room. The style is that you can make a style statement. Fuel economy is suited to one's financial limits in a comfortable manner. While driving past, one is sure of bystanders giving the car an admirable glance. Overall a justified choice in all aspects.

This car is very quality one, I had the priviledge of driving alongwith a friend, and the performance, and pick up is very good, but the cost of the car is very high, The interior comfort is very good, especially the back seat has good air-conditioning, which reaches to good cooling effect. Keep it up, one day may be I will be able to own one.

My experience with BMW is just not comparable to other cars like  Mercedez Benz, Cadillac, Honda, Volvo and similar range of cars.  The comfort one can feel, the balance one can experience (as a passenger or while driving), the power one can enjoy while driving and above all, the maintenance free smooth running of a life time car.  That is BMW.
i like this car for sylish,colour,sexy look people will look at us because of the car,first impression is the best impression if any minister is side of us on the road he will also have a look to us in this compition market among all cars BMW M3 is totally different.i doesn't have  words to teel about this car thanking you all i got good chance to tell my openion.
the build quality and general feel is exceptional,Just one problem that I can see. If I want a BMW saloon that has space, practicality, image and performance, then I'd be more tempted by the slightly larger, slightly cooler BMW models.......................

I BOUGHT THIS CAR LAST MONTH AND I CAN TELL U THIS IS A VRY  VRY NICE CAR,THE TOP ONE IN ITS COMPETITION,EVEN OVERDRIVE AND SOME OTHER MAGAZINES HAVE RATED IT AS THE BEST IN ITS SEGMENT.VERY LUXIRIOUS AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT IT IS THAT IT IS A PASSENGER AS WELL AS A VRY GOOD DRIVER'S CAR,I LOVE TO DRIVE IT ON THE HIGHWAY ITS JST TOO GOOD AND IN ITS SPORTS GEAR IT GIVES SPORTSCARS A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY. THE PASSENGER SEATS ARE VERY COMFY,FEATURES .................LOADS N LOADS OF.IN SHORT ITS A INDIAN LIMOUSINE.
Even now that it's powered by a muscle-bound V8 and has gained some 300 pounds, the M3 is still the automotive equivalent of a lithe decathlete. Acceleration is pin-you-to-the-seat thrilling and the agile handling is so composed that it makes the car feel like it's much smaller. Braking is astounding, as the M3's binders boast powerful yet progressive action and the shortest stopping distance from 60 mph -- just 100 feet -- that we've ever recorded.
and also make necessary arrangement for middle class people also because they are at large scale in population and make arrangement for easy finance also so that each and ever indian must be in a position to purchase this type of cars for theri personaly use.

it has got a good style, good traction control, etc., great pick up speed good looking nice i mileage etc,.compare to other cars in the same price range it one among the best. one of the nice car from the maruthi udyog limited so far.thanksssssssssssssssssssssssss

luxary level after primary needs. you can now expect what is our experiance ;hom much we can explai.that is enogh for me. Desire only insisted to"
good power and speed and also having good control
"The comfort is the feeling you gets when you drive, its difficult to explain. Real enjoyment comes while driving the drem car. Dreams can be as high as himalaya but always limited to your pocket.
Best car should able to run smoothly in all weather conditions smoothly and must able to run smoothly with excellent power in all terrains. I like my car thats why!"
All these are really par excellant in all respects.Fuel consumption, power, style, out look, safety measures, its interiors, spaciousness and all other features are really appreciable besides its comfort for the Man on wheel as well as sitting behind.

 Fuel economy is that of a typical BMW,Engine power and torque is disappointing for a BMW,gear box is kinda stiff

The time has come when you become the judge and write the destiny of cars that are going to rule this year. Voting is going on for India's only consumer choice car awards, CarWale Awards 2009. Vote for the cars you think India should buy and help millions of Indians make better car-buying decisions. Your vote counts, and it could win you free fuel for one year, a luxurious trip for two to Goa or many more other prizes! 
the car money value other than Luxury cars, and luxury feeling is better than other Luxury cars, overall the car is luxury and stylish car but fuel economy is not that much better, body style is good, and ground hight is not good.

"The BMW 3 Series is regarded as the Most Aspirational car of India for the present Year.This Series has long been regarded as the benchmark compact sport coupe, sedan and convertible.  BMW M3 has been a favorite of enthusiasts looking for sports-car performance.The Athletic look added to its attributes, which make this the Path maker car.
Changes were minor during the lifespan of this generation of M3s,and this sounds like it is the most stable car of the decades,perhaps the M3 is the GT of the future."

exteriors is really appealing and interiors too looks very familiar and cozy. After stating the engine you will experience the refined engineering. Gear box is easy on transmissions. Its acceleration is quite impressive and you can feel it while you overtake or find empty road to conquer. While driving you may find its fuel efficiency just as average but with its other features  of engine you having on your hand you will just smile to say its okay.

very bad experience, i have been saving for this for a long time and was very disappointed with the performance of the vehicle.. if i could get somebody to fix my whistling brakes that i find very embarrasing it may not be such a bad car.. anyone out there have the same problem????
the brakes on this vehicle sound like a friggin transport.. they keep telling me its normal, i was told to take it for a long run on the highway, did that too but to no avail.. i need help

"great...but price is too high. though the exterior and entrrior both are great but then you also think of the bucks that you spend. it's having great style and you will admire its look for sure. the fuel economy is another concern but with the latest technolgy in place in this car so that is also manageable. i like this care of its great style and the design aesthetics.
all in all a good car but 'gotta manage the money'!!!"
I studied the car on web site and wanted my son to bye it in USA. He is very happy with it after driving TOYOTA for 7 years. It has good apeed, sleek look, first class interiors, wide view and zips along motor ways and expressways without a noise.
Performance of the vehicle. with 500 horses under the hood. Braking is not as good as the engine, otherwise an excellent vehicle.
It is an Real Pleasure to possess and ride this car I have been getting many chances to ride this car for short as well as long journeys, different types of road conditions but I found it fit to all conditions. It's look, interiors, space  and technically sound system makes it the No 1 car under this category.  
nothing to say about it.......

Overall I got everything what I dreamt in my first lusxury car .

" 
Exterior To the contrary of people calling it SUV, compnay does not call it SUV, Hence we should not disgrace this CAR as Hatch back either, its a cross over some thing like BMW 5 Series GT. This is really a tall car when you compare with 3 series and will help people like me who are tall to atleast now have a good car where we can fit and drive confortably at 26 Lacs on road.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Its supereb quality, I owned Skoda Octavia, Innvoa and mostly those catogary cars, I have seen CRV and also Captiva and X trail, but this car looks so cool inside, I really love there Dash board design and lay out, very functional and no nonsense, though there is no iDrive, but it does have most of the stuff of idrive in small display. I also like there night time interiro lighting, they have nicely placed red led, which looks cool. You can even customise how the turn indicators should work, how the central locking should respond, car does self check every time you start, Its definatly state of the Art in its catogary, to the contrary comments by other reviewer who has not even owened this vehicle.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Its my first Automatic car, and I was always sceptical for its performance and millege, and to my surprise, its a awsome change, infact it changes gear even better than I could do, and car does not shy to get to 200 kmph, but I could not push it more than that (Indian Roads :) ). Cars enginge is really very responsive, many of time at signal when I am on first row, the car shoots from the line like bullet and goes faraway from other traffic. Fuel economy is very good, I get between 11 to 13 kmpl, considring the way I drive this baby its a very cool milege.
Ride Quality   Handling Ride quality is tunned properly for indian road conditions and feels ok, why ok not good because I did not find better than any of other premium car in this segment, but for passengers its really good diffrance, because of automatic oslation between grear change is not there hence confortable ride, Handling is good, but because of extra tallness of the car it does have little body role.
Final Words Awsome, what a entry level car it is, its for the person who likes to drive the car, and love tech in that. Also its best way to get feel of scarry service bill syndrome of a premium car, if you can handel it than a whole lot of options open up for you, I am yet to get my car for first service.

Fuel consumption is beyond anything. Its even efficient than my small hatches like Santro, Ritz and Alto. Its around 10 in the city and 18 on h.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox nothing to say here cuz I cant express the engine. u  guys just drive it to get the exact fact........its brutal, its insane, its raw, its extremely powerful and most intoxicating u can drive ever in a diesel! with that the 8-speed 'box works seamlessly to give u the most thrilling driving experience....after driving this u will forget Benz and Audi forever. simply best.
 
Ride Quality   Handling well well...we all know the handling of a bimmer....and for that we r ready to give up its ride quality..but if u get a smooth very flat and soft ride with that same unmatched handling, what will u do? ya, u need to think now cuz BMW is offering just that...........again I found this as the best ride-handling compromise I ever tested!

"Exterior Exterior is appealing. If you just see the car from the front, I can assure you that there is an 200% chance of you falling in love with the car. The car is made in an entirely unique and a new way; from the white Corona rings to the dynamic lighting system at the back or be it the XLine Pro (the silver fenders). It is a beauty to see it glide on the road.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Interior features are pretty much standard from X1 sDrive 20d. Especially the leg-room is exceptional. I have no words to describe the interiors of this Car.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance is ultimate. I don't think you can get this kind of performance and efficiency from this class. You just step on the accelarator and all you know is that your car is at a speed of 100km/h. Trust me, it has happened to me thrice.

"Exterior
 The exterior, although criticised to be odd in every review I had read, is nothing but a 3 series without a sedan boot and hence, is attention drawing when you see the car from the front at first. Because it looks long for the segment it is in (a hatch), it justifies its premiumness. Although the absence of xenon headlamps and LED tail lights may concern some, but in a crowded city where 2 wheelers are likely to damage the car more often than not, these low cost lights can surely put a smile on the owner's face when they are to be replaced.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
 Fabric seats are a great plus point over the Sensatec as I've found Sensatec upholstery to be very hard and heat emitting. I am also an ardent ahinsa promoter, so fabric seats and urethane stearing wheel give me peaceful sleep at night. Although there is no screen or i-drive, this car does have a diagnostics system where it informs you of the status of vital stats of a car like the engine oil, brake pad wear, etc. The audio system is also decent. A great thing about this car is the sensors of auto headlight and auto rain sensing wipers are highly accurate.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 The advantage of 116i over higher models is the higher profile tyres (as compared to low profile ones on 118d sport, etc.) it has giving the car smoother feel of suspension over potholes while driven in the comfort and eco pro modes. You hate that - put the car in sport mode and all your hates will turn into likes, trust me. The steering weighs up beautifully, engine response becomes free and exact. The tyres used by BMW are not of low rolling resistance type, hence fuel economy will be lower than otherwise. However, this feature is needed for a car of this acceleration (0-100 kmph is less than 9 seconds) for better control.
Ride Quality   Handling
 Great ride quality and handling in the sport mode. Great bump absorption in the comfort mode. You've got  both worlds and not the famously marketed 'best of both worlds'.
Final Words
 RWD, independent suspension, non-leather seats, 8 speed AT, auto headlights and wipers, big boot, runflat tyres, ABS, 6 airbags, DTCS, ease of driving in the city (length &lt; 4300 mm) - so if you are buying a skoda superb at this price point, please think again.

Exterior I recently bought a 320i in Bombay. The new sporty look on the hood is very sexy. The car has improved a lot from its previous 3 series versions.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
Space- Not bad (same like any Merc, BMW or Audi of its class), interiors - BMW could have done a better job.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Rock solid engine, great response. Fuel Economy sucks (but who cares).
Ride Quality   Handling Smooottttthhhhh ride and excellent Handling.
Final Words Anyone who wants to get the pleasure of driving should go for a BMW.
BMW = I have class
Merc = Look look, I am a new rich guy   lack class
Audi = 50%-50% between ""I am confused"" and ""Look look, I am a new rich guy   lack class""
If you are looking for a BMW and want a car bigger than 320 then DO NOT buy a 330, instead go for a 5 series. 5 series is better value for money. It is bigger, more comfortable and fuel economy is better as compared to 330 (since 5 series has smaller engine).
Lastly, PLEASE kick   kill anyone who tells you that a diesel engine ""feels"" the same as petrol - IT DOES NOT. If you are driving your car for more than 18,000 kms per year (for 4-5 years depending on the car) then it makes economic sense to buy a diesel car, else not. Before you buy a diesel please be rest assured that in the showroom it will sound similar to a petrol car but after 6 months or so you will find huge difference between both the engines. Car Diesel engine is nothing but glorified ""Farm Tractor"" engine.
Areas of improvement Interiors for sure. BMW can do much better a job - they should learn from Merc and Audi."
"Exterior Beautiful looks. matches the looks of a stallion. I am a big fan of BMW.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Very decent interiors. Expected space and comfort for a 3 Series. Car charge plug is under the Drivers hand rest which is bit unfriendly to use.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Excellent.
Ride Quality   Handling Very poor ride quality especially in the back seat.  The nature of the 3-series suspension is very hard which makes the ride more un-comfortable especially on Indian road conditions.  The vehicle appears to be a bit unstable at high speeds (160+ kmph) because of this stiff suspension.  Hence the speed has to be limited.  At times its difficult to contol the urge to get out of the car especially in rough riding conditions.
The steering control and its responsiveness is one of the best in the world.  I have driven many luxury cars but BMW is the best in this aspect.  One would feel that they are turning the wheels with their hands.
Final Words A good entry level luxury car but has been very dissatisfied with the riding comfort.
Areas of improvement I think I am very clear on the improvements required."
" 
Exterior Very good looks, aerodynamic styling, good proportions. Not too big, not too small.
 
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Excellent interiors, almost noise-proof, even with a diesel engine, only problem is a bit cramped rear seat. Very good for 2 people, not so comfy for 3!
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Amazing performance from the 6 speed automatic - single gearshift acts as normal / sport . manual modes. iDrive controls almost everything! Pleasure to drive around even in Chennai. Does not feel like a big vehicle.
 
Ride Quality   Handling Steering is a bit tight at lower speeds, but very responsive as we move along. Suspension could have been a bit more comfortable. Takes most of the bad roads with ease, but a bit bumpy with potholes - need to slow down to a crawl.
 
Final Words If you have your eyes on this, don;t think twice. Go for it.

Areas of improvement All wheel drive is missing - could have been there, for the price we are paying.

"Dear Sir/ Madam,
 
I purchased a BMW 520d from Navnit Motors, Andheri, Mumbai, on 5th Jan 2013.
The Car is now 6 months old, and is driven around 1500 Kms.
My ownership experience has been utterly miserable and would like to share it with you all.
 
List of problems:
1&gt; Within three weeks of ownership, the car developed a cracking noise from its suspension. Upon complaining, BMW acknowledged that it was a ""faulty suspension"" and hence replaced it.
 
2&gt; Within 1.5 months, the car remotes started acting up! All of a sudden, both remotes would completely refuse to work. At times the car would just not unlock. Even if I used the manual key to unlock it, the engine would refuse to start. Upon being left alone for a couple of days, they would start working again. It reached a point where, every time I approached my car, I would pray in my mind, ""God, I hope it starts""! Upon complaining several times, BMW Service centre repaired it.
 
3&gt; Around mid May, the brakes of the car started making some weird noise. The car was sent  to the service centre and they repaired it.
 
4&gt; NOW THE NIGHTMARE. The car came back from Navnit motors service centre on around 22nd may, after brakes problem got sorted. THAT NIGHT I TOOK THE CAR FOR A SPIN WITH MY WIFE AND ANOTHER COUPLE. I WAS ON THE BANDRA WORLI SEA LINK (LONG OPEN STRETCH OF ROAD), AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE BRAKES FAILED!!! A MSG CAME ON THE SCREEN SAYING &ldquo;LOW OIL PRESSURE, BRAKES COMPROMISED (OR SO)&rdquo;. NEEDLESS TO SAY, WE WERE AT A HIGH SPEED. THE BRAKES WERE BARELY WORKING AT 10% OF THEIR ACTUAL STRENGTH. FORTUNATELY, THE ROAD AHEAD WAS CLEAR SO I HAD AMPLE TIME TO STOP THE CAR. I DROVE MY CAR BACK HOME AT CRAWLING SPEED, WITH ALL FOUR OF US IN THE CAR THANKING OUR STARS THAT WE ARE STILL ALIVE!
 
The next day, I called up Navnit BMW, and got my car towed back.
They took about 3 days to respond with what had actually gone wrong with the car.
 
Their reply was that THERE WAS A FAULT IN THE ENGINE, AND SO THE ENTIRE ENGINE HAD TO BE REPLACED. THEY SAID THE ENGINE HAD TO BE IMPORTED FROM GERMANY AND SO IT WOULD TAKE A FEW DAYS, AND SO THEY GAVE ME A LOANER CAR TO BE USED IN THE MEANTIME.
 
THEY TOOK 50 DAYS (FIFTY!!!) to return back my car.
 
During all this time, I wrote several times to BMW India as well as BMW Germany, saying that BMW should accept their moral responsibility, and acknowledge that they have given me a FAULTY car, and hence not just replace my engine but REPLACE THE CAR INSTEAD!!!
 
But all my letters fell to deaf ears and the only response I got from either of them was to have patience.
 
50 days!!! Seriously! BMW thinks they can take people for a royal ride.
In those days, two of my EMIs have gone through! Imagine paying for a car that you cant even see around you!
 
In none of my letters did I ask BMW for any sort of monetary compensation. All that I wanted was something that I paid for! A reliable high quality product! I guess I was asking for too much from BMW.
 
After all the ordeal I faced with the car, after putting my and my families life to risk, after making me wait agonizingly for 50 days for my car to come back, after making me pay two EMIs for a car that is lying in BMW garage, all they did was leave me with no choice but to accept my car back. As a good will gesture, they offered me dvd screens for the back seats, which I really am not at all interested in and hope they take it back!!!! Aah, and free door mats. I think that&rsquo;s what BMW thinks of Indian customers. I am sure if all this happened in Europe or US, BMW would have to shell out a lot as compensation. But here in India, they think the can dump their faulty products and simply get away with it!
 
If that&rsquo;s not the case, then WHY WAS I GIVEN A CAR WITH A FAULTY SUSPENSION, FAULTY BRAKES, FAULTY ENGINE, FAULTY REMOTES???
 
No answers from them, just kept asking me to have patience!
 
I was promised, in writing and orally by BMW CRMs from western region as well as all India, that the car, after being repaired, will be thoroughly tested and will be fault free. So much so that, one of them even said, &ldquo;I will resign if there is any other fault in your car!&rdquo;
 
The car was delivered to my place two days back. At first, I didn&rsquo;t know how to relate to the car, but with a heavy heart I thought lets move on.
 
The VERY NEXT DAY, I REALISED, THE USB PORT IS NO LONGER WORKING.
 
This is HOW DISGUSTING BMW INDIA IS!!!
 
I AM COMPLETELY ASHAMED OF BUYING THIS CAR, AND AM SO SO DISGUSTED WITH MYSELF FOR MAKING THIS CHOICE!!!
 
I feel so CHEATED!!!!
 
HAVE COMPLAINED TO BMW AND THEY SAID THEY ARE SENDING THEIR STAFF TO MY PLACE TOMORROW TO &ldquo;REPAIR&rdquo; IT.
 
I hope by sharing this with you all I make you aware of the &ldquo;standards&rdquo; of BMW INDIA (or the lack of it)!
 
Every detail mentioned above is true and is documented with both, BMW and myself.
 
If there is any way you can help me get justice, I would be eager to know that.

 what to say on a BMW
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
 Driver and front passenger is perfect . The auto controls and the manual tilt for the front seat is really good . 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 the engine is powerful , and the in  sports mode  its quite fast . I used to own a Yamaha RD 350 , and the pick up of 320 d is the same or even better .
I have obtained upto 20kmpl on straight stretches minimising breaking , and avoiding quick acceleration - ofcourse not crossing 80kmph  . However it gives an average of 14 - 15kmpl driving at high speeds in the highways . In city driving it gives 9.5 kmpl . I have done more than 20000 km and the car is showing its second service due . BMW claimed that the service interval is 15000 kms , but thats hardly the case . The first service was at 11500 km
Ride Quality   Handling
 Ride quality is not good  as the tires are Run Flat and hence quite bumpy . The Bridgestone Turenza 205 / 55 R16 which comes as OE , is almost gone after 20000 kms  . Guess I will have to change the tyres at 25000 and this time I am going for tube less as I am told that ride quality improves signifcantly . Planning to put 225/50 R 16
Final Words
 A great sports car , but sadly we dont have the roads for making this machine sweat !
Areas of improvement  
 Like I said earler , rear seats aare clumsy .

Exterior Beautiful, amazing presence from the front!!
 
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) This car deserves to be fully automated, manual seat adjustment in the corporate edition kind of takes the gloss of this otherwise perfectly crafted machine. also the walnut trim could have been added for this edition, its only a lil bit in the front dash so dont know how much money they can save by omitting it.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Car is responsive to the gas pedal. in sports mode this baby is ready to fly!!
 
Ride Quality   Handling Despite the crappy roads and all the reports about run flats, this baby takes the load of ur back. stiff steeringcan get u a lil tired if u have to turn a lot but at quicker speeds makes the car very stable unlike the audis power steering.
 
Final Words Life will never be the same.
 
Areas of improvement Throw us a USB port as well for 25 lakhs. in this digital age an aux outlet is jus plain tacky.

"Exterior It scores a 10\10 for its looks.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Features are quite awesome but a little more could have had made it just PERFECT! Space is for six people but you can squash in one more. Comfortable is THE word for it! And very safe also.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance is totally smooth. Has a little problem for the mileage though. Gearbox is NOT 'inside the box'. You don't need to change the gears every time you increase or decrease your car's speed, it does it automatically! So both your hands are on the wheel and you simply drive.
Ride Quality   Handling Well if u say narrow roads, then it's not a sparrow car; because that's how SUV's are. You need to be an expert at driving if you are in Gurgaon specially for the hazy driving which others do.
Final Words Take care of your X1 if you want it to be No.1. Overall it will be 8.5/10.
Areas of improvement Mileage i.e fuel if petrol. {But for diesel it is good}"
"Exterior Lovely attractive looks, very shapely and sporty, the curves are attractive and beautiful.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Good features, comfortable saeting, bit cramped at the back seat.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Smoothest drive. The engine is powerful and noiseless for a diesel. Pickup is great.
Ride Quality   Handling The best driver's car, love every bit of it though I would be happier to have parking sensors at both front and back.
Final Words Surely the best car in its segment. Just go and buy it, much bettter than the Merc and Audi similar cars. This car has the looks, is great to drive, creates the best imprssion on the road.
Areas of improvement Provide another spare tyre for Indian roads. Given that Indian roads are full of potholes and bumpy rides, having just four tyres is a big risk. I have seen at the service centre many cars which come in with totally run out tyres."
"Exterior Great BMW looks, powerful stance.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort Pretty good but not luxurious. The dashboard and interior lights are great. The trim is average.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Takes off like a rocket! In the sport mode no SUV can match this baby. While motoring it purrs along with the high performance diesel making only a soft gurgling sound. The automatic gear box is reasonably crisp and gear shifts are clean. In a new car I'm getting 10-11 Km a litre on largely in town driving so not bad.
Ride Quality   Handling Great. The steering is not too light. It does not feel like a soft sedan but gives you the feel of a bigger vehicle. Cornering is fine, does not roll and the steering feels OK in your hands. High speed driving (I have only managed 120 Kmph) is just great.
Final Words BMW is one of the car brands that one dreams of. The X1 is the most reasonably priced way of buying into the brand and it does not dissapoint. It may be reasonably priced but all that BMW stands for especially 'the joy of driving' is all there.
Areas of improvement Wish they had given the idrive features on this model."
"Exterior Good looking car with good built quality.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Interior is good but low seating and getting in and out is bit teadious. Features are good. They could have provided reverse camera as well.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Good, The car is excellent to drive.
Ride Quality   Handling Is not good for rough roads which are more in our country India. It is not the car for India.
Final Words NOT A CAR FOR OFF ROAD. PLEASE DONOT BUY WHO WANT TO USE IN INTERIOR OF INDIA WHERE ROADS ARE BAD AND THE TYRES GET CUT AND PUNCTURED REPEATEDLY.
Areas of improvement Tyres should be taken care of as they get cut even with slightest impact. I have tried all types of tyres and ultimatly given it up and sold the car. I prefer not to buy this car as long as our roads improve."

Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Definetly we can't say anything negative. If you are inside the car you feel you are James Bond. have a lot of features, handy.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The perfomance of the car in sports mode is superb. 0-100 in a 3.2 seconds. Its an un-matching power yet its an highly economy car with 37.5 Km only for the petrol engine.
Ride Quality   Handling The electronic assisted rack and pinion steering, with the ESP technology, gives you a brilliant assistance during the driving. The head-up display is an another guidance..
Final Words And Finally, every person who came to know about this car will like to buy this. That much attractive car. Yet its price here is Too high, here.
Nothing to say in this topic, Yet INDIA needs to consider the Hybrid Sports car (with 95%recyclable materials) and reduce the import duty, So that polluton level go down.
Areas of improvement Nothing, yet rear seat should be improved a bit so that it will look even more better."
good car and better value for money than the mercedes e220 for 500000,its got the german bullet proof technology which makes the best engines in the world, as compared to the mercedes the transmission is far far better and is bound to give much more trouble free years that mercedes, but the spares and after sales ( service ) can be a difficult and expensive job.good car with more prestige involved and available at a very less price,

"Dear All Prospective BMW Buyers,

This is with regards to the extremely unprofessional attitude as shown by BMW India. Based on this, I have consulted my legal department and as advised by them, we are going ahead and taking the following actions :

1. Invite a Press Conference soon with the Press and Television Media Journalists to expose all the documentatary evidence that we have in writing from your Dealers - Especially from Bird which shows 
    how unethical is the way of luring a customer in this highly competitive Indian Auto Market.

2. Write about my experience to various auto related magazines in India and Germany and also create a blog on the internet to make all prospective car buyers aware about my experience with BMW.

The Exterior is curvy and sudden slides at times but that make the style statement of BMW. It does have perfect figure to give it a second look. Shows the legacy of BMW from the front and the back is perfectly meaty. Having a big arch for the rear tyres gives a feel of macho feeling.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
Interior is again soft and leathered, awesome carpets to feel like youre in the top of the line brand vehicle. Cabin is silent and filters out the traffic noise to enjoy a company fitted music system thats quite better than others. The controls are handy and on steering and you hardly need to do anything on the dashboard except you want to keep on fiddling with it. One can get used to it by driving it for couple of miles. The steering is tilt and telesopic. You need some shoulders to drive this car as the steering is not featherlite. However, its perfectly complimented with auto gearbox and both of your hands are on steering all times. The OVRMs are perfectly controlable and you can electrically fold them while parked at narrow spaces. The front seats are electrically adjustable sets to your best requirement. The rear seat to me was uncomfortable as the angle of the seat is a bit more straight than what i preferred. But with arm rest and plenty of legroom one can snooze on long drives easily. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Engine is refined and oozes out that 184 BHP with Torque as required. Overtaking is like a blink of an eye for this car. Chandigarh to Pushkar in Rajasthan (650Kms) was flat 6 hours 20 mins with no stop over. That was THE Best drive i could make it and you just dont feel sometimes that  you are 170-180+ The best i could take this was 205 for couple of minutes between Jaipur and Ajmer. However, the best speed i could see it on a long drive for this car is around 130. Its takes on the highway manoverabliity quite briliantly at this speed. The city driving economy is around 10 and sometimes even 12 based on the conditions. The short autogears help you drive anywhere. Night driving is also a pleasure as the lamps are awesome. 
Ride Quality   Handling
Try turning this car at 80-85kmph on a 90 degrees turn and while you can hear that skeetch but Zero body roll. Thats the perfection. You do feel large potholes but the one we normally have on Indian roads goes unnoticed. I have beaten Audis and Mercs many times on a road racing. There is no competition from any brand anyway.
Final Words
Everybody likes to move on from the common cars to these top of the line brands and what should be kept in mind is the power, comfort and safety. This car give you all. And mind you THE SERVICE IS NOT JUST WONDERFUL BUT AWESOME. You dont need to remember what is required when. BMW Service helps you managing it.

Final Words I have purchased a BMW X1 from their Chennai dealer (Kun Exclusive) on 4th Nov. 2011 and they have delivered a defective vehicle. As I reside in Cochin, I have started communicating with them where I have not received a proper response and action.
Hence I approached BMW India New Delhi and exchanged many emails and telephone calls without getting a reasonable response, action and respect to a customer where they used to repeat the same words of the dealer; as if the guys in BMW customer relation is paid by the dealer Kun Exclusive.
Finally I took up the matter with BMW Germany customer care and my repeated reminders ended up saying 'your complaint has been forwarded to concerned dept..
(Please see the complaints registered with BMW India below).
I am fed up with this irresponsible BMW as they force me to drive an unsafe vehicle. Finally I have decided to take up with the legal system as well as to the people in the country.
We (few NGO's and media guys extended support) are preparing to do road shows in Cochin - two bullocks will be pulling my BMW X1 on the streets and highways - as well as we will be distributing brochures detailing my complaints and how BMW treated it in front of BMW Cochin show room for the next few months.

"I bought a 320D in Jan 2012 and after the intial hype, I found that this car come wilt a lot of Limitation and you have to live with it. The after sales and the service centre tends to potray helplessness and hide their laughter that how "" we conned one more of the fools to buy this Car"".
You feel so helpless that after paying so much money you are short changes with a Pathatic car which can not be even compared to a Skoda in terms of comfort and bumpiness of ride.
When the issue was taken up with the Dealer and the service center, the reply was that is how the suspension is designed and the ride will be bumpy and that this car is not designed for Indian roads and one should checked before buying this car rather than comlain now.
Bottom Line: Do not buy this car unless you intend drving it on roads outside India. Do not buy it if you going to have it driver driven. the back seat is meant for kids only."
"Exterior
The design is very cool and trendy. Clean lines (you cannot take your eye off the BIG bonnet in comparison to ANY car/suv) and a dramatic change at the back with some neat cuts. The kidney bean grill is a tad bigger than the 3 Series. The lights are neatly designed, very BMW, smart fog lamps, classy sun roof and finally the height of the car - definitely smaller in comparison to the X3 and other SUV's but the large wheel base gives it the height you may be looking for.(the feeling of a SUV when you sit inside). But when did BMW ever claim it to be a SUV, they call it a compact SAV. If you want a hatchback instead of a sedan, for more space, its worth the try.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
 The iDrive not only gives the dash a trendy look but is also a very useful devise to navigate your way with the features. It would have been completely worthwhile if India supported the navigation system. Lacks some of the automatic sensors, the cruise control and hill assist (if i were to compare features for the cost u pay. you get all of these in other brands for lesser cost). Its definitely a 4 people car and the fifth should be a kid. But very comfortable knee room and head room in both rows (i am 6ft tall and can easily walk in and walk out unlike crawling into bucket seats). The second row seats fall flat (not 180 degree though) and give u the space u want to bundle your dog (i have a St Bernard) or for more luggage 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
This is where the BMW quality kicks in. At 2000 RPM, the surge is surreal. You can enjoy the power on long stretches and even for that little push to over take in city traffic. The sports mode could have been better, lacks a wee bit in the turbo u would expect in DS mode. But you can live with it. The AC is powerful and does not disturb the engine power. . The gear box is responsive and the economy is purely based on your usage. It can change with every day    
Ride Quality   Handling
The experience of the rise is what you buy this little toy for. Good suspensions, body roll is minimal unless its a terribly bad road. Fantastic (and surprises you) on the curves. Fairly noisy engine on the outside but very quiet in the cabin. Its difficult to believe you are driving a diesel car.  
Final Words
No automobile will provide you with everything you want. I was scouting for a SUV, a mean machine but ended with this toy. Like many of the new breed of SUVs, this is not for off roading. Why did i end up with it? Apart from being a good machine: The brand (the BMW badge can kill the Hyundais, Toyotas, Fords, Skodas of the world in perception), brand values, fits my requirements of space and power, easy to drive in congested traffic, definitely gets the look, and provides a sense of pride
Areas of improvement  
You may not use all the features all the while but the X1 could provide you with some extra features (a chiller box for example) definitely.

"Exterior I think this car has the best design in its class. The huge bonnet, and the tapering headlamps with the circular daytime driving lights make this a majestic presence, especially at night.
Plus very useful features like side illumination while parking in dark areas and BMW Runflat tyres only serve to enhance it.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) I had test driven the Mercedes B- class, which is the same segment as the 1-series and I didn't like it even half as much as this car. Right from the positioning of the seat to the feel on the accelerator is perfect. And why not, since firstly, it is a rear wheel drive car, secondly the power output is a whopping 145 ps( which is equal to that found in SUVs generally, which are much much heavier than this HAtchback) and thirdly, it is a BMW.
Space-wise I would say the front seats are very comfortable, with features like thigh support and lumbar support in addition to electronic seat adjustments. But the back seats become a little cramped during long journeys, because the legspace isnt all that great and the seats tend to feel a little rigid. Indeed this is the only thing I did not like about the car.
Also a quick word on the features ;The car is packed with useful features, some of the lesser known ones being -  1) Control of the entire car and its vital systems like tyre pressure, engine oil and service reminder etc. all through the infotainment system. 2) Anti-reflective inside rear view mirror to protect from glaring headlights. 3 ) Battery of the car charges each time you press the brake, so it makes it that much more efficient 4) An automatic engine stop feature that will switch off the car if you stop for about 5 seconds, like maybe at a traffic light, and restart the car in under a second when you lift your foot off the brake pedal ( this is really awesome).
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Fuel economy is pretty great because of the 8-speed gearbox and I get around 15 during regular driving and upto 18 on long distance highways.
Engine performance Only one word : sweet! There are three driving modes in the car - Comfort, Eco pro and Sport. Comfort is for regular driving and Eco pro for if you are stuck in traffic or something when it will maximize your efficiency; But stick it into Sport mode and whoosh! You are gonna be wowed by the instant boost the slightest touch on the accelerator gives the car! This is the one and only factor that confirmed my decision to buy this car and it annuls every other drawback completely."
"Exterior
Sporty and mean Looks.. It may not have the killer looks of A4, but it looks has a purpose.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
Front seats are very comfy, but for CE, no electric adjust..  Excellent viwe.. But you need to almost crawl into the car due to a low stance.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearb
It begs you to drive faster.. Can not make out the speed even while doing in excess of 120 Kmph.. Fantastic handling. Steering feedback is great tho' a little hard, but after 2 years I am pretty used to it.
Ride Quality   Handling
Poor ride quality on bumpy roads.. tramlining was a big issue.. Changed to non-RFT and the problems vansihed. Handling is fantastic. The best I have driven so far..
Final Words
The ultimate driving machine.
Areas of improvement  
Rear seats are cramped and is a squeeze for more than 2 adults.. May be the new model will be better in this area..

The new X5 (E70) is a monster of a car yet has a real sense of finesse.  With a real head-turning dominance on the road, the interior is equally palacial with great quality materials used throughout.  The 3.0d engine is very powerful but, understandably, does not seem to have the Bhp to move this 2 ton machine very quickly from a standstill.  That said, it will comfortably tow a caravan up to 1700kg through the Alps without complaint but don't expect it to hug the winding roads with the same sort of poise as a Porsche Boxter!  Indeed, even with the M Sport model, there is notable body roll through medium to tight bends.  Fuel economy is not fantastic returning about 30mpg combined but overall, Beauty really has met the Beast!  Highly Recommended.
"Exterior Looks are decent. With the extended bonnet, driving becomes difficult, for new drivers who are not accustomed to extended bonnets. Wheel arches looks proper. Overall the exterior is befitting a BMW.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Seats are leather and electronically adjustable. Dashboard is workable and ergonomics are just almost right. No frills except the BMW sound system, console and gear stalk which has P, R, N, D, and Drive Sport. Numbers on the dials are clear and give you information in a display of yello and orange and red colors.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance is fantastic. Although it comes with a standard 2.0 litre engine churning out close to 180+ horsepower, the initial pull-off is a bit sluggish. 0-100 takes close to 7 seconds and the Drive Sport takes it to 190 kmph plus on the highways. Gearbox is smooth, however i faced problems with the Park function initially as the vehicle moved forwards and backwards a bit even in Park mode.
Fuel economy for the X1 could be the deal-breaker. For highways it was close to 9 kmpl and city came close to 7 to 8 kmpl at maximum.
Ride Quality   Handling Ride quality is excellent, only if the roads are excellent, otherwise the suspension is a bit on the hard side. I do not know why BMW did not think of making the suspension a bit softer given the fact buyers absolutely want the vehicle for travelling purposes and not motorsport.
Handling is a bit hard for new buyers who have just switched from a power steering to a hydraulic steering system. On the brighter side, the hydraulic steering make sure you keep your wheel steady at high speed, albeit the traction control on.
Final Words The X1 is good, but with that kind of money (close to 40 lakhs) you can actually have many different options like the Toyota Fortuner, Mitsubishi Pajero, Chevrolet Captiva, Trailblazer etc. All of which give you the same or better features at a lower cost.
Areas of improvement Areas of improvement are many, but not really befitting a BMW badged vehicle. Needless to say, it can be better in terms of ride quality, after sales service, options and fire salesman from BMW workshops who pitch you products that you do not need, every time.
One more thing, even if you do buy it, DO NOT LOSE THE KEY. A new key will have to be shipped over from Germany whcih will take ages. 
Good luck."

"With the 2009 3 series being launched, dealers cannot keep the 2008 models on their showroom floors anymore. Additionally, all demo cars need to be sold. This is where I came in.
 
I walked around the 2008 320d Highline. What a lovely looking machine waiting to rev at all its horses. The inside is contemporary German all the way. Fantastic fit and finish with high end plastic, leather and wood. The speedometer and odometer so typical of a old German car yet, the iDrive which is so perfect. After using it I cannot help but think why all cars do not have an equivalent. 
 
The seat adjustment is kept simple and puts you into place in a few seconds. The driver seat well is nice and large and a tall person need not put their seat all the way back saving some legroom for the rear. The push start/stop and the key are oddly placed but it’s just something one needs to get used to. The car starts and I hear the hushed clatter of the power plant. A simple movement of the gear shift of the steptronic gear box and I was off.
 
The German feel was at the forefront again. Meaty steering that will not allow you to turn the car with one finger and rightfully so. It took me a minute to get the feel. Next I found some road and pushed the accelerator and she went like a rocket. What acceleration! And what amazingly controlled braking! Very surefooted, precise and solid handling at all speeds. I gave the sales guy some more jitters and drove back to the showroom.
 
What to look for when buying used: Ensure that the runflats have never gone flat. Its disastrous in road conditions like we have in India. Current price of a single runflat is about Rs18K. It will reduce. The BMW secure plan is an excellent buy. 
 
To highlight the differences between the 320d and the 320d Highline: The former comes devoid of the iDrive, side window blinds and a high end sound system. There is really nothing more left to desire after driving this car. It is just a brilliant piece of engineering.

"We bought a BMW X1 cars before 7-8 months and now facing a lot of problems e:g No spare wheel, No jack, and rear seat are the worst to sit and travel. Normally company says that you can drive BMW for more than 200 Km without air in tyres but in our case it runs for only 12 Km and after that we have to hire an another car in 42 D Cent and reached the destination.
Company representative are also very rude and no-body is take responsibility of the problems.
I think in the company like BMW, higher authority should take care of the customer and not the manager of Workshop and other staff who even don&rsquo;t know the how to respect the customer (Specially Parsoli Motors Ahmadabad).
I do not know in this competition how company will survive. God Bless You. My Advice Buy Bullock cart but don&rsquo;t buy BMW X1."
"I bought the car 1.5 years ago and have driven it close to 30,000 Km. It was my dream to own a BMW but sadly 520d shattered all my dreams.
The car looks good on exteriors and has an amazing drive quality. But the interior space   comfort is horrible. 
The car has to go to workshop every 20-25 days because the tire burst off or the alloys get tilted which has never happened with us ever before with any other car. Whenever we have to travel outside Delhi to roads like Haridwar or Aligarh every time alloys bend and it is a nightmare to drive this car now.
Service is horrible.They do not even provide pick up   pick drop service. Car has been delivered to me many times without even cleaning, all covered in dirt. Overall Horrible experience after spending almost half crore rupees.
We have taken 5 insurance claims in 1.5 years only because of the tiers and alloys. 
Overall a very bad experience with such an expensive car. Buy the car only if you want to drive it alone or with fellow passenger just at times."

The new luxury legend. I planned to buy a luxury car. I zeroed on BMW 5-series Face-lift,Merc E-class and Audi A6 3.0 TDi. I did not consider Volvo S80 as the car looks boring. All tested and I zeroed on the BMW.

Exterior This is for sure not a BMW at all. When you buy such a car you want have some features. This is just like a Honda Accord. No features but because the name is big people want to buy it. This is definitely not an SUV, no not at all. The height of the car is just 4-6 inch more than a SUPERB/PASSAT or something like that. But if you are a hardcore show off guy and not at all tech savvy and features person  then this is the best car for you. Sooner or later everyone on the roads will get to know this and as soon as you people will get to know that this car is a bad choice all showing off will be down the drain.
 
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) I would much rather buy a SONATA Embera. The interiors are so blan that after the tenth time that you sit in the car you would feel that I burnt my money. No screen, single CD changer, no iDRIVE. Does this sound like a luxury car. It does not to me. The only good this in the whole interior is the steering wheel because it has the BMW LOGO (I also love it).
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox No clue here but being BMW I guess it is super AWESOME. Driving pleasure and BMW go hand in hand.
 
Ride Quality   Handling Same as above.
 
Final Words Girls are not dumb any more so if you are buying this car to impress girls then this is a total NO NO. EGO satisfaction, 100 kms and then you will realize that there is no ego in buying this BMW (it is not a 5 series). One should go for a SUPERB instead. I hate the car. If you have the money then wait for another year or so, save some more and buy 5 series. And If you really want to buy it right now then at least buy the top model. BMW introduced this just to remain number 1. This is not an SUV (as people might think) this is a hatchback.

"Exterior It's the BMW stying philoshphy that I can't fault. The car looks sporty, lean, and muscular.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) I like the space. I drove this car as a solo driver mostly but I think it's good for two as well. The boot is also quite spacious. Features-wise, the GPS is great. Navigating the menu while driving is easy and fun. Steering media controls are cool.
I didn't like the aircon at all. If the car has a temperature setting, it should just maintain the temperature, which the 116i didn't do well.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox My first car was the City VTEC 2002. I was hoping this car would perform at least as good as that car but the 116i is a major disappointment when it comes to performance. The car is fairly quick and much better in first and a little better in the second gear but it's simply not fun that point onwards when it acclerates lifelessly and is missing 'roar'
Fuel economy of this car is really bad. I drove around 1000 kms at a fuel economy of around 12kmpl. There was fair bit of driving in the mountains but not excessive breaking or gear shifts. In today's time, I expect better from an engine this size.
The gearbox also isn't as crisp as ...say a SWIFT's. This is completey unacceptable from a BMW.
Ride Quality   Handling I drove this car up to 130 km/hr and on long (20 km) 110+ kmph stretches. On all grounds, this car is appalling in stability. It doesn't stick to the ground firmly and when passing trucks I realised how flimsy the grip felt. This is one car that doesn't inspire confidence at higher speeds. Forget Honda City VTEC (old), a Swift Petrol does better. The steering is great. It's a joy. This car is a delight to manoeuvre.
Final Words Overall, if you drive this car before buying, you'll probaby never buy any BMW. If I have to spend so much of money, there are great options from other manufacturers. More importantly, if you are a BMW fan, never drive this car.
Areas of improvement BMW should get rid of the 116i."

"UPDATE - As of January 2015, I have managed to clock 28,000 km which includes at least 12 trips to Bangalore and one to Goa.  During a recent trip, I got around 22km/liter driving at 130km/hour.   The tyres are showing wearout and are due for replacement.  I have had a few tyre punctures but they were easily fixed at a roadside tyre repair place within minutes.  So, all this talk about run-flats being a risk is utter nonsense.  Of course, you should not deliberately abuse the tyres.
Exterior still looks immaculate since I have taken great care to maintain it (pressure washes, mirco fibre cleaning, liquid polishes every week).  Interiors are also in great condition as I have managed to enforce a strict ""no food"" policy so far :-)
Overall - I am still a highly satisfied customer.  
Rest of the review below....
Exterior
 Is a stunner.  Great finish, solid build.  Recently two teenagers banged their bike right into my door but the dent created was very small compared to the force of the impact.  On another occasion, my side mirror was forced shut be an incoming vehicle but nothing bad happened. You can actually feel the quality of parts.  Try doing the same with some of your favority Japanese or Korean models.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
Most features are standard in all BMWs of the current generation.  I miss the ""SOS"" button that I used to have on my older BMW 330i, back in the USA.  Also, for Indian variants, they have foolishly removed ""Cruise Control"" and rear-seat split options. 
The driver seat memory option really helps my driver and I to swich our settings.
Leather seating is very comfortable and rugged at the same.  There is good tigh support.   Compared to Audi, this feels even more high-end and well designed.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 184 BPH of pure joy greets you the moment you step on the gas pedal.  Though I drive using ""Eco Pro"" mode for efficiency, occasionally, I flip to ""Sport"" to remind myself of why I bought this beauty !
Acceleration is linear, transmission is super smooth.  Fuel economy in the city (with bad traffic) is around 12kmpl while the highway driving with speeds around 140kmh is round 21 kmpl.
Engine does make the ugly diesel sounds when at lower speeds.  You can't really make it sound like petrol.
Ride Quality   Handling
Even when I am making sudden lane changes or turns at high speeds (exceeding 100+ kmph), the car never squeeks.  It feels rooted to the ground at all times.  When I break, I seldom worry about what is in front of me.  I have to constantly worry about breaks of the car behind me  :-)
Ride quality is best in the ""Comfort"" mode but overall, sitting in the back is not as pleasurabe as it should be.  I find Audi, Merc or even a BMW 5-services offer better back seat comfort, especially for long drives.  Having said that, I must admit that this current generation 3-services has come a very long way to improve suspension in this car as compared to what it was in the 5th generation 3-series.
 
Final Words
In one sentence, I would say that I simply have NO regrets over my choice even after 14,000 km.
 
Areas of improvement  
Cruise Control is a must have feature
Back seat comfort should be further imporved
Back seat audio controls could be a good option (especially for India where in even 3-series cars are chauffeur driven)
Back seat split should be provided by default

"Hi my parents, recently bought (Nov'13) 320D from Infinity Cars (Indore) and this what their experience is,
""I am an unfortunate, punished customer of BMW 320D which I bought in Nov'13 from Infinity Cars (Indore, India). On 12th Feb'14 when I took this machine for its first long drive, 2 tyres got ""flat"" without any indication of tyre pressure on screen (we just escaped from accident due to it)!! When I informed your dealer about it, instead of accepting machine falut,he asked us to buy new one (though there is 1 year warranty) as he said insurance will take more than 1 week to just see the tyre (while selling he said insurance will be taken care within 24 hours). Left with no options (I had no convience to come back home) he asked me to pay $1300 immedaitely and claimed that after insurance, within one week, I will get full refund back.
When I did a follow-up call, he informed that he will deduct 60% of amount (for no good reason). While he was fitting new wheels, we got to know that he used old wheels while giving us the car!!   adding to shock, he was installing wheels of 520D forcibly in machine. Luckily, our driver observed it. We also, learnt that there is a common workshop for Audi, BMW   Mercedez from where he was getting repair done.
It has been more than 2 months   I haven't received any amount from him or communication. When I called him today, he said that he doesn't have my contact!! (while selling it to me, he called 100 times!!)
I bought it because I had faith in your BRAND and I lost it now. I have nowhere to go   complaint. Is this how your brand treats customer? I feel cheated, blackmailed   helpless""
So, in short, its better to buy a Maruti Car than this fake post-sales service brand irrespective how beautiful the machine is. Its better to get test-rides   fill your hunger!!"

if you buy a BMW make up your mind to spend atleast 5-6 lacs every year on maintenance for regular work not accidental.
I have driven the car only 25000 KM till now because of all the problem faced, the car has spent about 3 months in the service station and about similar time standing at my garage because of one or the other problem."

Exterior Amazing road presence, attracts a lot  of gaping stares ! grat styling aspects include the front wheel side countour bulge, the sunroof increases the pleasure quotient even further.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) The ""i drive"" is exceptionaly awesome, leather and dash is fantastic, elecronic seat adjustment is a boon for the driver, aircon at the rear works wonders even on sweltring hot days, the electronically operated rear curtain is handy for improved privacy.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine works like a beast under wraps all u need to do is push the gas pedal to let the monster loose, 12kmpl diesel is more than satisfactory for such an amazing engine and car with a all its features, the bmw automatic transmission is like no other and if u wan  to do the extra bit of sports on your ride then you alays have the option of manual transmision and this coupled with DTC could make it even more fun.

This bimmer is different from any car ever made by BMW. The best thing about this car is its music and I am NOT referring to the sound of the radio but the ENGINE. the mighty 4.0 liter V8 engine produces a massive 420 bhp of power designed in the M labs of BMW where its F1 engines are designed. It is the most advanced V8 engine in the world and is absolutely a thrill to drive. You can change the chassis and the suspension setting with. the touch of the button located on the steering wheel. Once to Turn the traction control off and then put the car in sport mode then there is nothing controlling that mighty engine except you the car just accelerates from 0-100kmph in just 5.7sec and that is really fast. This BMW also offers a DCT (double clutch transmission) which keeps the car accelerated even during the superfast gear change. Thus making this car BMW have stand by their quote of "Sheer Driving pleasure" and this car is nothing but that.

 awsome..a perfect blend of SUV, Vagon and Sedan. good to see from front. its big bonnet will catch your heart..Even the Cheaper CE variant gets electrically adjustable front seats, the Driver seat gets 2 memories which can also be set to the car keys.  I find the seats a bit too soft for my taste, the shape and size of seats is all great. Rear seats too are well set up, it is not too upright, the headrest is softer than other cars which feels like pillow Being higher set than than an average sedan it&rsquo;s easier to get in and get out.

I acquired a space grey BMW 320D (Highline) almost 4 months ago (July 2009). The car has done nearly 3000 kms so far (within the city and on highways as well). It has an exccedingly good performance and both low and high speeds and one is in complete control while turning corners and breaking. The car certainly lives up to it's image of the "ultimate driving machine". The handling and response of the vehicle is exceptional the DSC function keeps the vehilce in complete control while the breaking is effective at all speeds. The drive is smooth and comfortable and high speeds and external noise are hardly felt inside the cabin. I was keen on a manual drive version but unfortunately BMW has no immediate plans to lauch the same in India. However the automatic gearbox adds to the driving pleasure with well syncronised gear shifts and I now feel that it is much a better drive than the manual gearbox. The car has three drive modes regular, sports and sports manual and the gearbox smoothly transitions the engine from each mode to the other. The cabin is very comfortable with qualitiy climate control and a great sound system. The iDrive feature is great and extemely useful but requires getting used to in order to operate it while driving. It has so far delivered good mileage for a 2 litre diesel engine (14-15 kmpl on the highway and 10-12 kmpl in city conditions). The run flat tyres have not given any problem so far despite having travelled 3000 kms, in fact they add to the driving pleasure by providing fantastic road grip. The aftersales support provided by the local BMW dealers (Parsoli Motors) in Ahmedabad has been great and the BMW Secure and BSI packages cover servicing, repairs and spares well and although optional are highly recommended. This car is built to be owner driven only.

totally rocking car. nothing bad actually except a little bit harsh ride due to RFT's  but it is nowhere near uncomfortable. I wouls siggest you go for the 320d version as it has smaller rims hence the ride quality is improves a little bit. and the performance is mind blowing and the handling is very good as i have the 325i . a mileage of 10.5 on highway and 9 in city is good for a car like this - highly recommended. also, its seats are better than the mercedes c class even thought the mercedes has a softer ride..

520d didn't measure up to my expectation. I drive an Audi A6 and compared to it, BMW ride was stiff. 2 literI engine is less than adequate for this car. Gearbox is nice and completely electronic
Ride Quality   Handling
you have multiple options in the newer model. Comfort drive is most comfortable on bad roads. Mumbai roads are bit too harsh for this BMW
Final Words
Car does not live upto BMW image. If you are BMW fan, buy 530D. 520D is poor compromise by BMW to shave some top line of the price. But lot is lost in the process

List is long. Match 530D features. Tune 2 liter engine like Audi has. BMW should remain a drivers car

"Experience at BMW dealerships for after sales has always been sad , depressing and a big problem in terms of waiting , appointments , timely delivery etc.
There is a waiting period of 20 Days for appointment for a normal service. This shows how under staffed they are or lack of infrastructure for after sales.
It seems after sales service is not a priority or of any importance to BMW or there dealers. They have just no respect for your customers time.
The dealership does not even have adequate staff to handle the appointments and the staff they have is mostly untrained or under training to make the process even slower.
May be you should take your dealers to a Toyota workshop to see how professionally   efficiently they work without wasting any time and most importantly respecting and valuing customers time and appointment.
All this was not enough so your Dealership has now hit the bottom of the pit as they have now has started cheating customers by replacing worn out parts with second hand/old parts instead of new.
This is in reference to the Support assembly of the left shocker of my car which was replaced on 21 April 2012 this particular part has a warranty of 2 years but it broke down in just 5 months
This clearly indicates that the part changed earlier was either A second hand / old part or it was repaired and put back in my car and the dealership kept the new part for itself.
I do not understand how can a part which has a warranty of 2 years give away in 5 months???? I am sure Maruti parts are also stronger   trust worthy than this.
I would like you to help me solve this issue and also confirm whether it is a second hand / old / repaired part or a manufacturing defect in your part.
Warm Regards

"Hi, I am a Sad owner of BMW 320d 2012 ( new shape ) and owning a BMW has only filled my life with Sorrow, misery   sadness. In last 02 months I have taken my car to Bird Auto 07 times due to an irritating sound from front suspension over pot holes   even on slightly rough roads.   After repeated checks   road tests by your so called expert mechanics the workshop guys are not able to rectify the problem because they cannot diagnose the problem properly. Either they lack training from BMW or they are those cheap unskilled road side mechanics that BMW has hired for Saving costs. Unfortunately they are not able to rectify the same even after changing a few nuts, bolts/Parts. Your after sales service has even become worst   has hit rock bottom now as basic parts also are not available  at your dealers for which we have to wait for weeks   after replacing the so called parts the problem is still not rectified. I have gone through enough of Mental trauma, Stress   Harrasment caused by the unprofessional behaviour of BMW   your dealer. There is no Joy anymore in owning a BMW infect i am only facing Mental Trauma , Stress, harrasment   Depression after becoming a BMW owner.

Areas of improvement Fuel Tank Lid design is pathetic and I wonder how dumb can BMW's design team be. Its pure plastic with a small plastic pin which breaks by just touching it. BMW is know for Safety but here they have failed miserably. Any other car in the world has a better fuel tank lid design. I have pointed out this egregious blunder to the BMW Service Team at Hyderabad as I had to get the lid replaced twice. I have repeatedly told them that the onus of responsbility rest on them to highlight such relevant recurring problems to the top managment  so that corrective action can be taken.

The common perception is that someone who can afford the money for a set of wheels like a Beemer or Merc to get between point A and B, couldn&rsquo;t care less about fuel consumption.  The BMW dealer tells me that customers&rsquo; do enquire about fuel consumption while deciding to buy.  We also know that the reality is, BMW and MB sell far more diesels than petrols.I experimented with my 320d which has now run about 36,000 km.  I tried to get better fuel consumption while recently making a trip to Mumbai from Pune in afternoon.  I was the only person in the car, and there was no baggage.  Thus, the car loading was minimal.  I tried to get better fuel consumption while maintaining reasonable highway speeds.What could I achieve ?  Starting from Pune, I had to drive about 28 km to reach the expressway, and then till exit of expressway the meter recorded run of 28 + 91 = 119 km.  I could get average speed of 96+ kmph and fuel consumption of 16.7 kmpl !  Obviously, average of 96+ kmph was possible by putting Beemer&rsquo;s road holding capability on turns to test.  On one sharp turn, ESP was triggered and controlled the car.
Ride Quality   Handling
Ride is bit hard in city as compared to Accord, Merc C Class, Audi A4, but good damping. Handling at speeds and twisties is unbeatable.

"If you consider a gold Rolex Datejust restrained (which, in a way, it is), the M3 is a subtle-looking car. With the aforementioned flame surfacing adorning the base 3-Series, BMW&rsquo;s M people headed to the &lsquo;hood for inspiration. The M3&rsquo;s power dome and flanking indents compete with its gaping maw and steal-me side mirrors for bling props, whatever that means. With a black carbon fiber roof, the overall effect is inconspicuously ostentatious.
The M3&rsquo;s cabin remains cleanly styled and elegantly proportioned. The Coupe&rsquo;s sports seats are exactly what the 1-Series ordered, but didn&rsquo;t receive. The armrest is a welcome upgrade, while the anthracite headliner continues to provide hush, hue and aroma. My tester&rsquo;s fox-red (a.k.a. borderline bordello) Novillo leather added to the eau d&rsquo;M3. Optional carbon fiber leather is the Fran Drescher of trims (far more appealing than it sounds).

"BMW 3 GT. Car is good to drive and in performance. Like looks of it. Was loving it until my front windshield broke again.
It broke in October for first time with no reason, BMW took more than month to fix it under warranty. Now again same thing happened after 6 months. They trying to deny it on warranty saying its external impact, last time too they tried this external impact formula on us, but at end they were convinced last time, but this time they are trying to force to get money from us.
Worst car company EVER, not taking responsibility of their faults. Car manufacturing defect they push on customers, Stating its external Impact. My car windshield broke twice in 6 months without any reason in parked condition. And both times they show me same zone, stating that external impact was done. Even though area they mention is not accessible without opening of car bonnet. Cant attach pic here so linking it."
"To start of with, this car is not value for money. It looks good from the outside but for the money you pay for it, you expect more than exterior looks. Rear seats are uncomfortable mainly for lesser leg space. There is no GPS in the car. (not sure if we were supposed pay extra for it but its not there in our model). More than anything when we bought the car, the company people said we were supposed to change the oil every 15k km but after we bought it, the light kept coming up after only 6k km. This wouldnt have been a problem if oil change cost was few thousand rupees but this is BMW, so the cost is about 40-50K per oil change. So the dealer pretty much lied to us. BMW is also not having spare tire. Though the dealers say the car can manage upto 200 KM after the tire is flat, it would still be problem in India where BMW dealership are so few across the country. For eg. in Karnataka, there is only two dearlership showroom across the entire state (Both in Bangalore). We bought our car with Navnit Motors in Bangalore. Please beware of these people and if youre still planning to buy a BMW car, take everything n anything they say in writing so it could be used in court. If you have any questions about this car please feel free to reach out to me on my email dharsha11@gmail.com. I hate BMW dealers and would advice you not to fall for these big 3 brands.

"I purchased a BMW X6 for $60,000 and I simply adorre this car for it's fuel economy, simplyn becuase the X6 is a hybrid, BMW's first!
The people at BMW have combined a hybrid transmission with a four-cylinder diesel engine.   One of the benefits is that this is a smooth running car.  You barely hear the engine running.  It's user manual is just that, a user friendly guide that aquiants the owner with every aspect of the car.  My only negative is that the paint is easily scratched.   The paint job is wonderful.  My X6 is what I call an enamal burgundy.   I stronly endorse the 2009 BMW X6 if you want to drive with peace of mind and style.

"This vehicle is just a crossover, but it is not a real crossover and that its looks and trough are not very clearly defined to say that it is a crossover.
There is bodyroll at speeds of more than 4000 rpms. Also there is turbo-lag in this vehicle.  The gears are a bit slippery and the steering sometimes is a bit tight when steering at high speeds.
Actually the type of tyres for this vehicle is not at the level they ought to be.  Even a tyre for the mercedes benz ML 350 would be the apt set for this vehicle as the tyres very much kiss the road more than keeping it at a blade's end.
The ride is very harsh with  lack of off-road capability and that the H-point seating very much would give a stress and strain to the low back region of the person who is driving.
Also the mileage is just not more than 9.5 kmpl and any rework may result in the engine performance going BOING! GA! GA!."

Final Words Any new engine is big news to us, but when a new powerplant comes along and replaces one of our favorite engines&mdash;BMW&rsquo;s naturally aspirated inline-six, in this case&mdash;we pay extra-close attention. This fall, the base Z4 and 5-series won&rsquo;t have the perfectly demure and smooth-revving inline-six. Instead, the Z4 sDrive28i and the 528i will have a new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder implanted between their front fenders.
On paper, the engine is off to a good start. BMW claims the turbocharged 2.0-liter makes 240 hp at 6500 rpm and 260 lb-ft of torque at a low 1250 rpm. The redline is 7000 rpm. Compared with the naturally aspirated six of the 2011 Z4, the new engine comes up short by 15 horses but bests it by 40 lb-ft. Given that it has two fewer cylinders, it&rsquo;s also shorter, and the majority of the engine&rsquo;s mass sits behind the front-axle line."
"Dont touch a BMW even with a barge pole!!
I was shocked to find out the hard way that after paying to much money, I get an alleged brand new bmw 320d in march 2011, that has major water leakages and major manufacturing defects and issues such as a dsc pump error etc and the company and their dealership pass it off as a minor issues and say that thats what the warranty is for:). SHOCKING!
The story about the car not requiring to go to the service center for 15000k is all humburg! Read ahead for a detailed note on this:
Once an ardant fan of the BMWs, now I wish I hadnt touched it.
I have had a BMW 320d highline for about 6 months now. BMW talks of being a company that prides it self on its premium quality and manufacturing excellence, I will proivde you hereunder a small example of its poor manufacturing quality and its even worse and uninterested aftersales service, which again they promise to be exceptional.
Over a weekend a couple of months ago I discovered that my car has got leakages from the rubbers in between the passenger side door and the body frame and the back passenger side door and body frame. 
I had seen water dripping from the passenger door frame earlier but had thought it was because the window might have been open of the car may have been washed but this last weekend the car was flooded.
If that wasnt enough, It also stated giving me Flat tyre monitor error and to top it all at their service center itself just when they claim they were going to return it to be me, it started giving a dsc error for which the BMW service managers now claim is a pump issue and the pump will need to be replaced and therefore will take time to come as its been ordered. Imagine all this in a spam of less that 5 months. Build quality---Ya Right!
If this wasnt enough the service persons of BMW also just dont care. They didnt come to pick up the car  inspite of them being aware that the carpetting was soaked and the car couldnt be driven due to the ftm error. They didnt even revert inspite of assuring that they would until I called them and reminded them to fetch the car when I got told that they have a packed schedule and therefore would schedule it as and when they could and only on my insistance they came late that evening and took my car. Even after they took the car for repairs they didnt get back to me about the problems or the status of the car, till I once again called and spoke with their senior manager who cross checked and then someone called back. Thereafter again, they have been extremely calous about their approach and dont call call back or revert until and unless I call up and follow up. The car if you must is still in their workshop and they have already told me 3 times that they are sending the car but then discover a new problem in it.  If this was the service assurances of BMW then I really dont know what to say. 
Where is the quality of manufacturing premium, top quality cars in all this? I see a car that is of extremely poor built and manufacturing quality and it seems to have been made without any attention to detail. Its all rubbish that BMW believes in making cars that add to ones driving pleasure without worrying about a thing. IF this is their superior/premium quality I think one would be much better off picking up something which is at half the price and will atleast not leak and neither will you need to deal with persons in their service department who are completely unconcerned and unmindful of their customers or the customers requirements.
Inspite of all this they have the audacity to say that they will just repair it and give the car back to me. I would have thought that after seeing so many serious manufacturing issues in the car they would be readily willing to replace it and on asking them for that, the answer I got was, they cannot guarantee that the next car will not have issues. TALK ABOUT HAVING FAITH AND CONFIDENCE IN PREMIUM BUILD QUALITY. I think this statement says it all.
I hoping to get a better response from the Company decided to directly write to them in germany and india. They are also not bothered at all about it and the first 2 mail exchanges made it amply clear that they didnt give a damn.
This ongoing experience is turning out to be such a horrific experience with BMW and I do hope that they solve the issue but its already left such a bad taste that I wish I had never spent so much money or purchased this car in the first place and suggest strongly to others also not to.
Would never ever recommend a bmw to anyone."
"I got this car in late 2012 after an extensive comparison with Audi and Mercedes. I really liked the model 530d and bought it. It had been very satisfying experience with the car performing great for a year. Technology wise, it is really great and very comfortable as well. Interiors are plush and rich. Just loved the car.
However, one incident has shaken this comfort level dramatically. We were coming back from Noida after attending a wedding. Around 11:30 pm, we noticed a slight wobble. None of the indicators came up. I got down and saw that the rear right tyre was half full and a bit warm. So, we drove down slowly to the nearest Petrol station (4-5 kms away), but by that time, the tyre had burst, stranding my family along with our wedding stuff. The Run flat indicator was still not on!
After 3 hours!! of contacting BMW assit, the truck came in and took the car to the work station. Long story short, I would like people to really consider this Weakness of BMW before buying. BMW has told me that Nails or screws induced punctures will strand you like this. Also, the assistance service is not their's, so no SLA there.
I didn't realize the importance of Spare wheel till it happened to me. We could have been stranded on the way to Chandigarh on the Highway and would probably had to wait for 6-7 hours to be rescued. I would gladly exchange my 530d with an Audi A6 after this."
"Based on the present-generation 3 Series, the current BMW M3 was introduced for 2008. There is only one trim level available among the coupe, sedan and hardtop convertible body styles. Each is powered by a 4.0-liter V8, good for 414 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque, which revs to a thrilling 8,400-rpm redline. A six-speed manual is the standard means of sending power to the rear wheels, and a seven-speed automated-clutch manual gearbox with paddle shifters is optional. M3s also get specific hardware upgrades such as more powerful brakes, stiffer suspension tuning and a specialized limited-slip rear differential.
Like previous M3s, the current model comes well-equipped with the latest luxury amenities, which in this case includes xenon headlamps, leather upholstery, heated power sport seats and a 10-speaker audio system. The convertible features a nifty hardtop and sun-reflective leather. Features like 19-inch wheels, heated seats, satellite radio, the iDrive navigation system and M Sport personalized performance settings are optional.
While past M3s have been performance stars, the new M3 coupe is quite simply one of the best cars to grace our test track. It accelerated from zero to 60 mph in a blistering 4.6 seconds and came to a stop from 60 mph in an extremely short 100 feet. The slalom and skid pad test results were also on par with vastly more expensive supercars, while on-road handling is beyond reproach. Regardless of which body style you choose, expect one of the best performance machines money can buy.
Past BMW M3 Models
The previous M3 lasted from 2001-'06 and was available in coupe and convertible body styles. There was a single trim level for both, powered by a 3.2-liter six-cylinder engine producing 333 hp and 262 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed manual transmission was standard, while a six-speed sequential manual gearbox (SMG) was offered as an option starting for the 2002 model year. The latter allows manual-style shifting via paddle shifters next to the steering wheel, and although it was popular, we weren't fans of its herky-jerky performance.
Changes were minor during the lifespan of this generation of M3s. A CD player became standard for 2002, while the following year saw the addition of a few extra convenience features plus an improved DVD-based navigation system. (The former one was CD-based.) The only major addition arrived for 2005 with the Competition Package (coupe only), which provided some of the performance hardware from the European-market M3 CSL, such as 19-inch forged wheels, revised suspension tuning, a quicker steering ratio, upgraded brakes and a less intrusive Track mode for the stability control system.
Every road test of this M3 sang the car's praises in terms of its incredibly balanced handling, prodigious grip and telepathic communication between car and driver. The downsides of this no-compromises performance car are few: a stiff ride, tinny exhaust note, and more wind and road noise in the convertible than one might expect. For die-hard sports car enthusiasts who need four seats, it doesn't get much better than the BMW M3. However, these cars tend to be driven hard and owners frequently modify them, so it's important to examine a used example closely before signing on the dotted line.
The second-generation M3 was introduced in 1995 and was a tidy package, with only its subtle rocker panel extensions, tri-color ""M"" badges and different wheels to separate it from the common 3 Series. Along with a buttery-smooth 240-hp inline-6, this generation of the M3 wooed enthusiasts with its ripping performance, finely balanced chassis and everyday livability. For enthusiasts on a budget, this is perhaps the best deal for a used M3, combining a wide choice of body styles (coupe, convertible and sedan), along with plenty of entertaining performance and an affordable price tag. The coupe ran throughout this generation from 1995-'99, while the sedan (1997 and '98) and convertible (1998 and '99) were only available briefly and are consequently harder to find.
The first-generation BMW M3 was the most radical. Running from 1988-'91, this M3 was essentially a hard-edged, racetrack-ready version of a 3 Series sport coupe. These M3s featured aggressively blistered fenders fore and aft, slightly thicker C-pillars that allowed a more aggressively canted rear window, and a higher trunk lid fitted with a large spoiler. Under the extroverted bodywork was not an inline-6, but a highly-tuned DOHC 16-valve inline-4 that cranked out, for its time, a very impressive 195 hp without the help of a turbocharger or supercharger. An unmolested first-generation M3 is a rare find these days and tends to require more maintenance and care than the second-generation car because of its more specialized four-cylinder engine.

BMW was founded in 1913 by Karl Friedrich Rapp, an aero engineer. The company was named Rapp Motoren Werke and was located in Milbertshofen, Germany. After Germany lost World War I, aircraft construction was halted as a condition of the Treaty of Versailles. This forced the company, by then titled Bayerische Motoren Werke, to shift their focus to railroad brakes. From there they went on to motorcycle engines and then motorcycles.In 1928 BMW bought an automotive company, Dixi, and produced their first car, the BMW 3/15. World War II redirected their attention away from cars and back to cycles and airplanes and they wouldn&rsquo;t produce another car until 1952.Although BMWs are now manufactured all over the world, the BMW logo is a sign of their heritage. The blue and white roundel stands both for the flag of Bavaria and also depicts a white spinning propeller against a blue sky. Today's models are some of the most dependable and stylish vehicles on the road.

Exterior-doesnt looks good for the value paid Looks a bit dated and doesnot give the expensive looks which it should give. The alloy wheels are a bit weak and even has a dirty look.
 
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Just fine..the interiors are good value for money with good furnishing but still a final touch up may make it better.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Very thirsty,average performance. It is powerful and gearbox is crunchy but it gives below average fuel economy which is a great problem.
 
Ride Quality   Handling Very good, a good off road car but sometimes gives a bit of rear suspension problem. The suspension has a shreiking sound and sometimes road sound comes.
Final Words A good powerful and ugly car. Its very much powerful and a youth's car but designs and looks go against the great BMW made X3.
 
Areas of improvement Exterior designing. an overall change in the exterior style may make the car better and a final touch up in the interiors, a little bit peppier and fuel efficient engine may be better for the car.

"My charted accountant told me that, central government has extended the date of 50% depreciation on cars till Sept' 09 end.
As I own Merc, Audi etc., I thought to buy 5 series BMW to take the advantage of depreciation. I requested for a demo car.
The car features, comfort, safety etc. are same like Merc   Audi except flat tyre technology. 
The vehicle ofcourse a wonderful metal piece.
But to my surprised the vehicle noise was high   there were minor vibration to body, but steering wheel was vibrating like typical heavy duty diesel vehicle (The said vibrations are totally absent in 7 series). I discussed the matter with vehicle representative; he told me it’s normal.
I don't know the vibrations were due a used demo vehicle or inherent.
It was shocking experience from 5 series BMW 2009 model. 
.... Finally, I did not buy the vehicle.

"Exterior :
Looks fabulous from every angle; with 8 colour options. Sleek and powerful. In a word WOW!  
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort): 
Spacious interiors with colour options for double stiched uphlostery. The dashboard layout is simple, and controls are eazy to find. It can seat 5 comfortably. The rear seats fold to increase the boot space. For those who like to worry about office   keep in touch, while driving, there is the ""iDrive"", with a high resolution screen.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox:
The 20d has 4 cylinder, 2 lit engine delivering 184 PS and max torque of 380 Nm. The 30d has a 6 cylinder, 3 lit engine delivering 258 PS and max torque of  560 Nm. The 8 speed automatic transmission  delivers power smoothly and strongly. It has Dynamic Drive Control and the car smoothly shifts between Normal, Sport   Sport+ modes.  Fuel economy is pretty good, and the automatic Start/Stop function, and brake regenaration feature increase it for the power this car generates. (Note: The one mentioned in the Mileage is for the 20d)
Ride Quality   Handling
The placement of the longitudional engine is such that it gives the car a very good road grip. The independant suspension for all the four wheels, the precise response to electrically assisted direct steering, for this all wheel drive help you to weave through traffic, or even at high speeds give a firm road grip. Cruse control with braking system has been provided, making long drives comfortable. The high driving position gives better road view, and is an advantage while manoeuvering the car.
SAFETY:  BMW X3 Gets Maximum 5-Star Euro NCAP RatingCrash Test: Highest Points: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FoXHcSoIkk
Final Words
On the basis of performance, the BMW X3 won the Bloomberg UTV-Autocar Luxury SUV of the Year 2012 award. Has 2 engine options, 2-litre and 3-litre, both are disel so more economical to run in India, has 21.2 cm ground clearence, so belly won't scrape on the crater ridden indian roads (especially during monsoons), or some axle breaking speed brakers. Has wide 17"" (20d) and 18"" (30d) ensure great road grip, great ride. Finally a BMW is a BMW, quality comes with the label.
Areas of improvement  
In a hot country like India with summer tempratures around 42-48 degree Celcius, a SUN-ROOF is not a desirable or a luxury feature (as in Europe where it is very cold, and, 25 degrees Celcius is considered piping hot). Here we need protection from the sun.
 Indian city roads and highwars are heavily smoke and dust laden. So a powerful air filter for the air conditioner, and an air ioniser would be highly desirable to protect the lungs.
Can run on a flat-tyre, but a spare wheel is still desirable."
 any SUV fails yaar what else. shouln't even think of any SUV or any sedan MERC or any other brand in this range. engine noise is even quite butterfly horn is like makes u feel like heaven nor penetrating rather bearable. BMW defines it itself 'm
"BMW M3 Coupe appears to have taken the best cues from the current 3-series coupe and improved upon them. Subtle side skirts help to enhance the &ldquo;dropped&rdquo; appearance of the car, while under-platform refinements to the near-flat floor help to enhance under-floor airflow. The vehicle is nicely accented with the M logos located in the center of the &ldquo;gills&rdquo; on each side of the car.
The BMW Double-Vanos system of its variable-valve timing technology delivers the appropriate power for nearly every situation, while at the same time lowering emissions. The good stuff does not just reside up top, either.
At 4.0-liters, and 414 horsepower at 8400 rounds-per-minute, the engine displays an incredible power to weight ratio of 8.8 lbs to one horsepower. Torque weighs in at 295 lb-ft, and BMW says there is enough of it to launch the M3 from naught to 60mph in a claimed 4.7 seconds."

Exterior I liked the look which was the primary reason behind the purchase
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Again good but nothing special.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Good but not great, doesn't have the great power you'd hope for.

Final Words Its a decent car, well actually a good car but the 5 series is nothing spectacular. I got a blue BMW 520D in Nov 2009. I have tried other 5 series   I have to say outside the BMW name the cars ain't that great. No it doesn't break down but if your going to spend the 50l(on road price now) then you better be getting something special. I have tried other versions of 5 series   again good but not great. Even the interiors are not that grand. Buy a Porsche 911 or an Audi A6 for better performance. If you have serious money to burn go for Mercedes SLK Roadster or maybe a Ferrari 458.

"The German automaker&rsquo;s entry-level SUV and has been on sale in the Indian market for over four years now. In that time it has revised the SUV at least twice and then began its local production.
Exterior 10/10  this is an evolution of the current car, being so, its overall design is more of a continuation than a new model altogether. It gets new bumpers, a slightly revised grille, redesigned mirrors, new body colour options and an update for the alloy wheels.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)  9/10  The overall layout of the interior remains the same as the outgoing model but gets much more premium appeal thanks to the chrome accents, coverable cup holders and new panelling.

"This car is a shining example of German engineering. All BMWs are crafted for excellent performance and unmatched reliability. Continuing in this tradition, the BMW M3 represents an eclectic amalgam of superb design, tough build, drop dead good looks, nimble manouvreability and great reliability. 
Cars built for Indian conditions have to be tough, a quality that this Beamer possesses in abundance. BMW M3 can glide over tough roads and harsh terrain smoothly, endure the Indian heat and dust comfortably and importantly, deliver exceptional value for money. In short, it has all the qualities that an Indian looks for - not just in an automobile, but in everything."
I went to try the car with alot of expectations and enthusiasm. But the whole experience from the dealership to the test drive was a let down. The car is quite decent on most parameters but when you compare it say the E class or the Audi, its such a disappointment. Keep the three next to each other and feature by feature you realize there could be so much more.

"This car is truly the car of dreams. Costing a small fortune, it brings all of the state-of-the-art BMW technology at the fingertips of the user. With controls for virtually everything in the car, it is almost like you need a specialisation degree just to drive the car. Which is why BMW arranges for the same if the new owner so wishes. With special training imparted to drive the Beemer the correct way, it truly makes the car an enigma.
Would really love to get this baby if ever I have that kind of cash to spend."
"It is traditionally known that the German carmakers are known for the quality of the products but BMW has made a benchmark of their excellence not only in the styling of the car, but the sturdiness, their safety features, and smooth ride.
The way this car holds the road and takes the sharp turns without losing the torque in manual overide is something to enjoy if one has the money to buy this car.
One hopes that they can reduce the overall wieght of the engine with some more lighter material which will help reducing the fuel consumed."
"BMW M3, now what to say about this car, this is the car, which always seems to me coming out of Bond movie and i am easily able to imagine Mr. Bond doing his stunts in this car, there is no need to say that this car has everything you can think of in a car starting from great style icon, to powerfull engine to comfortable driving to great space to lavish interiors, anything and everything one can imagine in a car, this car has all.
Now i always felt that this is the car which is much superior to Merc, which used to be the insperational car of every man and women some time back, but before the charm of BMW all the glory of merc is been lost, it just looks dull and old fashioned.

"BMW feels fresh and new ambitioned. It's quick and precise; beautifully balanced and brilliantly responsive; deeply confident and inspiringly competent.
The exterior paintwork likewise adds an individual touch, offering the connoisseur not only numerous additional colours, but also four special paintwork options exclusive to BMW M.
the engine compartment lid with its striking powerdome and the two air intake openings, the function-oriented design of the front and rear air dams, the so-called gills in the front side panels, the side-sills also in distinctive design, the roof made of clearly visible carbon fibre, as well as the exterior mirrors and light-alloy wheels in BMW M design clearly characterise the new model from the ground up. The exterior, in turn, through its athletic and aesthetic appearance, powerfully underlines the sporting qualities of the car.

"Exterior It's the BMW stying philoshphy that I can't fault. The car looks sporty, lean, and muscular.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) I like the space. I drove this car as a solo driver mostly but I think it's good for two as well. The boot is also quite spacious. Features-wise, the GPS is great. Navigating the menu while driving is easy and fun. Steering media controls are cool.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox My first car was the City VTEC 2002. I was hoping this car would perform at least as good as that car but the 116i is a major disappointment when it comes to performance. The car is fairly quick and much better in first and a little better in the second gear but it's simply not fun that point onwards when it acclerates lifelessly and is missing 'roar'.
Ride Quality   Handling I drove this car up to 130 km/hr and on long (20 km) 110+ kmph stretches. On all grounds, this car is appalling in stability. It doesn't stick to the ground firmly and when passing trucks I realised how flimsy the grip felt. This is one car that doesn't inspire confidence at higher speeds. Forget Honda City VTEC (old), a Swift Petrol does better. The steering is great. It's a joy. This car is a delight to manoeuvre.
Final Words Overall, if you drive this car before buying, you'll probaby never buy any BMW. If I have to spend so much of money, there are great options from other manufacturers. More importantly, if you are a BMW fan, never drive this car.

Exterior From the exterior, once you see this car, you will fall in love with it. They way BMW engineers have crafted this great sedan is really aprreciabel. The long front of the car reminds of the 7 series sedans. Being said this car is a nothback and not a sedan. The bootspace is huge and the visible curves around the doors and the boot lid makes the car look alike a great sports machine.
 
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) The interior is typical BMW typish but the plastic quality is excellent again reminding you to 7 series. The In built GPS and Music System have plenty of options for In - car entertainment. The legroom for the driver and front passenegr is great and the rear seats does not lack it also. The passenegers who would be occupying the rear seat will not be having any seating problem though. The features 6 Airbags, ABS, Auto Climate Control, Deffoger and Rear A.C and Rear Armrest also.

Ah! Enough power to make this super luxurious car turn into a true powerdul speeding monter. Fuel Economy is around 8kmpl in city and 12kmpl in Highways with an overall 10Kmpl which is not bad at all.
Powered by an 8 Gear Automatic Transimission, the Gear shift is quick and smooth. As you push the pedal you can generally feel the power of the car and if you truly want to taste its original pwer just PEDAL TO THE METAL.
 
Ride Quality   Handling Ride quality is awesome. Suspension of the car is great and both front and rear passenegrs can feel the superb riding quality, The driving is an ease and the rear passengers can hardly feel any bumps on the roads. Either High speeds or Low speeds , one cannot even feel even a single bump on road making the riding quality as ease as you are driving on a clean highway. This is very good as we all know how our indian roads are. The Drive is super smooth. Handling of the car is neither bad at all. Car handles great in the city and even at the speeds the car doesnt loose its control. At 180 kmph, one can handle the car in ease. Cornoring is great and the car is very stable at high speeds too. The top speed is electronically limited to 250 kmph.
 
Final Words This is a great car from One of the best luxury car Manufacuter. The car is great powerful machine and BMW has not left any area in the car that needs to be imporoved. The people who want the feautres of BMW 7-Series with the ease of 5 Series this is a great car. The Car is aggressivly priced and one of the best buy avaailable in the country.

&gt; Bold styling with lots of road presence; refined aggression and luxury style.
&gt; Looks best in Sapphire Black and Space Grey.
&gt; Pick the right alloys: 19"" and 20"" recommended to complete the look.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort)
&gt; One of the best-crafted BMW interiors, shared with 7-Series for layout and quality.
&gt; Tons of rear-seat space, lots of aircon vents in back, and storage. Very flexible first class style seating.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
&gt; Surprisingly quick off the blocks, startles other ""sporty cars"". Superb mid-range cruiser for long, effortless motorway cruising.
&gt; Average fuel-economy in combined city/highway driivng. Eco-driving through Efficient Dynamics makes this acceptable fuel economy but always use premium diesel.
Ride Quality   Handling
No compromise on BMW performance, precision and road feel for the enthusiastic driver.
New Comfort and Comfort+ option for rear-seat luxury if you like the Mercedes type cushioning (I dont).
Final Words
&gt; Outstanding package of bod style, 7-series luxury, interior space with comfort. Make me wonder why anyone would buy the 7-series anymore.
Areas of improvement  
&gt; Make panaromic sunroof standard (like in UK) as it adds to airy feel.

Maintenance is cheap and can be done at maruti workshops.  I didnt like the paint it had on when I bought it, so I replaced it with white distemper. Also there is some problem with the exhaust system, you can smell the diesel while driving the car. It might be the problem with the left door not closing well. When I complained to the servicing center about this, they gave me a handkerchief to cover my nose. They are very thoughtful about their customers and give excellent service, so I am very happy with it. My another problem is, when you are climbing uphill you have to turn off the A/C or else the engine will shut down.
Beware of the logo thiefs though. Its logo costs more than you make in a month. About as much as my hourly pay. So if you are me, buy this car now. 
 
I am selling mine for 4 lacs. Any buyers?
Oh and the mileage was not up to par with my expectations, so I installed an LPG Kit. If the smell of LPG bothers you I recommend opening the right window. This car only has one window.
Areas of improvement  
Top area and bottom area. Side areas are quite fine.

Exterior Exterior is average. The Ford Mustang Headlamps and Nissan GT-R Tail Lamps look good only on them, not on this. Fuel Lid has a very odd positioning. I know that this car is designed according to complete Aerodynamics to bring Air Resistance to ZERO, but this is made very ugly for that reason, the biggest question I have to Bugatti designers- A F-L-A-T Roof? Seriously?  BTW, an aiding help to accident while reversing, this has NO PArking Sensors or Camera, now I don't undertand what is this!Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) This car is SO long and shocks the shit out of me with the In-Cabin Space! This is as long as a Scorpio and has much lesser space, yes I too didn't expect Head-Room, but the seats don't have a healthy sliding range, though this has no 2nd row! But one point about it is that EVERYTHING is done with expert supervision and Quality in this car, NO rough edges. In terms of comfort, this is quite comfortable with highly comfortable seats but the suspension has no contribution as, if it would move, the car would LICK the Tar on the road. The Gearbox is placed too far for usage and I didn't expect such a Dumb Infotainment System, I expected at least a small screen for GPS or Reverse Parking, the Rear Glass gives a 'SHIT' visibility! And for a bigger shock, NO Parking Camera!Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is just un-matchable! Probably the most powerful car till today! Would tow away a  Boeing-747 if needed. Gearbox, though placed too far for convectional use is very easy to shift and doesn't give problems. The Fuel Economy is - as expected, very low. This barely ran for a 54 km on the Motorway with the tank fully filled.Ride Quality   Handling Handling is too hard with the Electric Power Steering, a Hydraulic one would be expected at this Price Point which would also do the job well for it's use. Ride Quality, is unexplainable, I don't know if it was the seat's comfort or the Suspension, but I believe that the Suspensions are bad as I myself saw how thin they were.Final Words This car is worth nothing but only racing, but not even that right now as there are faster cars coming up like the Koesinegg 121 and La' Ferrari which can beat this things speedAreas of improvement   Practically everything except Quality of Build and the Engine

 My review is for First Time Car buyers, who want good return of there money.We have choice in this segment 2.8L to3.5L - diff variants. Read this and decide your self.I've been using this car from 38 months crossed 75000kms. I bought this instead of Santro coz of milage. I knew it has less power, but didn't expected it to be so poor. 90% of time I'm alone even then feel the problem in pick up. Initially it gave me good average of 18km/Ltr with AC but now I'm getting 14-16Km/ltr.It hardly reaches speed above 115km/hr.  Braking is also not that efficient, seriously needs to be improved. It needs frequent servicing , specially the CLUTCH part which has become like old scooter's in operation. It has been repaired (polishing) more then three times. I have to get it adjusted after every 10000kms.Its really pain to drive it in traffic. Shockers are reaaly bad, you feel the complete profile of Road. Overall I feel very disappointed. I bought Santro also after year of using ALTO.I think if you drive around 80km a day then Maxm Life of this car is 80000-95000km after which it should be dumped immediately. My car has crossed 75000kms. I think I can drive it maxm. 15000kms more and will go for Better ONE....Well I decided to keep a driver for lato as its pain to drive it because of Heavy clutch and poor pick up. Also, now no one can blame me of not using clutch properly. Afterall they always have this excuse and can blame for poor driving skills.

Final WordsHi,I've been driving an Alto (800CC) for over an year now, here is my review: Well to start with we obviously bought this car for its cheapness,   little did we realize initially that most of d things are really cheap in this !! (now gng for swift/getz diesel)Pros - Driveability is good   v easy, drivers view is good, backing is easy etc.AC quite effective, at full speed i feel chilled in just few min time.City mileage has been arnd 13-15 depending on speed, traffic, with AC, etc. Highway mileage is excellent arnd 22 roughly.Cheapest car so obviously a + point as u save money (but at the cost of satisfaction)! low maintenance, cheaper parts as compared to other cars obviously.Easy   better for women drivers !  Power steering quite good, needs little effort, but felt size of steering wheel is large for this car.Never gave any starting problem till now (1+ year).Resale value   service of maruti a + point.Cons - Pick up is not good but okay for 1-2 ppl, but with 3-4 ppl pick up is v poor,   with AC pick up is horrible, u wld get frustated pressing the accelerator in AC !! can hardly pull 4/5 ppl with AC on !! Rear space is less, not much movement possibleVey jerky pick up in 1st   2nd gears ! the car can hardly move much in 1st gear   gives back a jerk if clutch not pressed slightly. Only from 3rd gear (above 30kmph) onwards jerks are not felt so much.brakes least effective of all the cars, only better than pulsar bike !Very less boot space (170L). Getting in   out of car is slightly uncomfortable (I'm 5""8').Nothing special abt interiors, avg plastic build.Left door has become rough at just 8000kms.Gear box not at all smooth, continous problems with reverse gear even after service ! Also the gear throw is longer than other cars.Day/night mirrors are not there, so at night time a lot of reflection occurs from front glass, side   rear view mirror. Night driving is really uncomfortable in alto.Long drives for more than 4 hrs (with small breaks) really uncomfortable   tiring ! Alto not meant for good long drives.Since the width of d car is not much, even if a healthy person sits in front passenger seat - the gear box tends to touch him significantly   comes in d way ! I've touched 130kmph on this car, but its not safe above 90-100kmph.My suggestion:If one can stretch their budget to 1.1L cars, then dont even think of alto  ! I've driven all 1.1L cars   they r better than alto in every respect (barring fuel economy for obvious reasons)Also if one is going for installment option, then going for santro/wagonR/spark wld increase monthly spend by approx Rs 1000 only, definitely worth it for your own satisfaction.
 
Areas of improvement The comment is totally a crap! Alto is an awsome car and have driven in Highways all around chennai, bangalore, kerala and Andhra. Found it really comfortable and ofcourse not very powerful as Santro and any other cars which may have a larger Enginie which is 1000CC or more.But, Alto is really a cool car for both highways and city rides. I have driven 130 KM max and I usually drive around 100-120 KM/hr. on highways. Still find it comfortable as any other cars I have driven. Which is far enough for Indian roads. If you are born for racing on Indian roads, then you could speak about the speed/km :P and to put in more money to get a power filled car.Also, it has got almost all features which is really worth the price! I have my cousins who has got bigger cars like Chevrolet, Skoda and Hyundai been spending so much on maintenance and fuel and ofcourse paying the EMI Back.I paid 3.2 Lac cash to get an Alto which lacks a very few things like power windows, Internal operated rear view mirrors a parcel tray. But it really worth the price.ALTO is known for Indian roads and Indians! It rocks!!!Mohan on 20 Nov, 2009 at 04:40 AMVery detailed comment , Thank You, I have feel of drive the car and experienced about it from your comment.Vipul Goel on 27 Aug, 2009 at 10:03 PMI bought an Alto Lxi about a month back, and am Very disappointed with the performance.Performance with AC on is pathetic. I also have a wagon R (since 2004). Buy this only if you cannot afford to spend another Rs.50000/- for a wagon R, or Santro. If you can, then please dont buy this. I have used it only for 1200 km, and am wanting to sell it. I will as soon as I get a reasonable deal (about Rs.260,000). Other than lack of pulling power, the seating is also uncomfortable- worse than 800.very bad car, dont buy it. i m telling this from my personal experience

"Exterior Excellent..envy to others..side drivers will keep on eyeing it. its muscular look and awesome mettalic colour is beyond comparison.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Splendid. It feels like seating ina luxurious five star room.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Awesome. great pick up and the sound of the engine..oh my god..you will fall in love with it immediately.
Ride Quality   Handling Well it is hard initially especially on indian roads..but after 2000km,it is smooth like anything.
Final Words Just go for it. No need to think if you are in mood of buying some good stuff. 
Areas of improvement Ground clearance can be improved a bit.initial handling also can be worked out. you cant expect good fuel efficiency,but being indian customers,they should work on it. there are not enough service stations in india. With this good reputation of the brand,they have to increase it ASAP. I had a difficult time when I had to consult for the hardness of the clutch in the beginnning."
"Exterior: Amazing! The aerodynamic shape is so curvaceous! She is a real beauty! Elegance personified!
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort): Minimalistic as its a super car and not the typical passenger car.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox: Two v8 engines combined to make a w16 beast churning out 1001 bhp! I own a Hyundai Getz which has 82 bhp. so I can easily sense what this monster is capable of!
Ride Quality   Handling: Saw a few videos on youtube. Amazing traction control even at such hight speeds. Superb quality of brakes (they use brakes made by a company manufacturing brakes for Jumbo-Jets) It brakes quicker than it accelerates.
Final Words: Amazing! Price doesn't matter to me as I am not going to buy it. And for those who can afford it, fuel consumption of 2 kmpl is the least priority! Not possible to drive in India with quality of roads. Wish I get a jackpot of like a billion!
Areas of improvement: Barabus TKR is proclaimed to be the fastest car now. Hope Bugatti goes even better!"

With its luxurious length of 4.47 m, the Veyron is a perfectly balanced combination of high-powered performance and sleek, racy design. Even at complete standstill, the car&rsquo;s enormous power is made visible by its impressive mid-engine, elevated majestically beneath the chassis. Simultaneously, the Veyron&rsquo;s bold proportions, well-balanced surfaces, and clear line structures give an impression of pure, sleek elegance.
The design of the Veyron honors a great heritage without drifting off into retro style. Every detail of the classic two-tone color scheme, a quote from the 1920s and 1930s, has been carefully thought out, resulting in the typical Bugatti profile with the classic, contrasting ellipsis &ndash; the stylistic element used by Ettore Bugatti himself. The &ldquo;crest line&rdquo;, which runs uninterrupted from the hood to the only 1.21-m-high roof, is a proud homage to the Veyron&rsquo;s forebears. Thus, the Veyron&rsquo;s classic paintwork and harmonious design connect this state-of-the-art super sports car to the glorious heritage of Bugatti automobiles.
With its classic look, the large radiator grill &ndash; adorned with the hand-enameled Bugatti emblem &ndash; represents the grandness of the Veyron. The sports car&rsquo;s distinctive front is defined by the harmonious contrast of its broad headlights and majestic grill. The rear end, 1.99 m wide, features the formidable retractable spoiler and generously designed fenders. The Veyron perfectly fulfills the main design objective governing the development of the new Bugatti: an uncompromising combination of highest elegance and state-of-the-art technol.

"Exterior Great looks lowest Ground clearence bad for city cummute Bt as good looking as my LaFerrari Bt ok ok.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Baddddddd As it lacks stiching and Cusioning of seats to I Bought for my Enthusiasm Bt now upset for buying it! U have to spend 14 crore on road!!!!!!!!!!......for me it's a cheap buy Bt.!!   for Others????
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Performacne is where Its I am Saying this Its WORTH PERFORMANCE.
Ride Quality   Handling Chiller ride quality!   Handling is very very very very very Good.
Final Words Nt Worth...Bt worth a Test drive.
Areas of improvement Price price price anD Comfort level shud increase!...Front looks sucks Bt back is where it looks Dope! ...Bugatti is having very less service station.. It costs total 8 lacs for total servicing..Believe me!  I have lots of bucks As a nawab of Brunei...Bt it's Costply for me too Just in my collection I bought it."
"Exterior Design not so attractive. The size of the car speaks against the size of my garage.... overall good exteriors.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Superb comfort, abundant space.. but the interiors are not so attractive.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Superb engine performance. Superb top speed. superb acceleration. ultimate horsepower. almost everything is ultimate exept the fuel economy. It cannot be used as the daily car. It can go reverse at 165 kmph. Overall good car
Ride Quality   Handling Handling is ok. damn fast. superb torque.
Areas of improvement Fuel economy is begging for improvement. Improvement is also needed in the interiors section. Also, the handling needs improvement. Not worth the price. So the price of this car needs to be reduced. The size of the car really needs to be reduced. The exterior design of the car is not so attractive. I also own an aston martin one-77 which beats the veyron hands down in the exteriors. Also the interiors.The design of this car needs to be improved.
Final word Damn good car. really good top speed(406.37 kmph) but needs improvement in the fuel economy section. Interiors look dull and hence need improvement. I really liked it overall."
"Exterior Fine and marvellous and red colour is just like the blossoming of roses.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Very spacious and having all the luxuries of supar car.Not so big but the person who will get a chance to sit in it will be the finest person in the world or a pure god gift on earth according to me.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Such a goog gear box and fuel economy is enough for everyone.Let me tell you one incident.Once i was watchig television when i suddenly saw that the most popular show(Super cars-Bugatti)was coming and i switched on to see that.I was zapped to see the fuel economy and engine in it more than anything else.So now you can imagine.How much i love it???
Ride Quality   Handling Somewhat difficult but easy to handle it at a speed of 200 miles/hr and braking power is excellent.
Final Words I am loving it more than anything else.
Areas of improvement Should be improved in the areas of cost and speed."
"Exterior It looks Fantastic the dual roof scoops-cum-wind tunnels add charisma to it.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) It is ""very"" cramped.interior os not satisfactory. Death is sure if u drive it in the city streets without precision.Brakes are very satisfactory which is a must in these rockrt cars.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox This is the finest of all.No other make can match it.Except the Mileage.
I always keep the gear in manual mode to control the car's insanity. if it would be in auto, then it would go like a rocket and not slow down untill you crash.
Ride Quality   Handling Handling is terrific except when you exceed 300 kmph.it vibrates till you reach 100 kmph (2nd gear). Every time i shift 1st gear, i have to precisely leave the clutch and push the accelerator. this gives pain in the legs, otherwise i you wold be heading for a crash, and i would be dead.
Final Words An excellent Marvel,engineering evolution. It is not suitable for regular driving,it needs a runway like road.
Areas of improvement Interiors,headroom,legroom,mileage. PRICE
 "
" 
Exterior Its nearest Competitors are less than 60% its huge price tags and are much more beautiful. RR, Bentley, Jaguar etc. look much more attractive and they have 4-Door models available.
 
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) Limited space vis a vis Jaguar, RR, Bentley etc. make this car looks cramped. Its only for 2. Rear seat is not comfortable even for kids.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Only Formula-1 racing cars can meet its power, dont expect anything in fuel economy, its a big guzzler. May be 1 KMPL.
 
Ride Quality   Handling Its low ground clearance can make life hell on Indian roads, else this should have fantastic road grip   control.
 
Final Words Its nothing but Show Off of Excess wealth, as this car is not practicle in most areas. Its Left Hand Driven car? Do Indian laws allow Left Hand Driven cars. Indian traffic condition another serious issue with it.
 
Areas of improvement Bugatti should take clue from Jaguar, RR, Bentley etc. They can sell 5-6 cars. may be for museums. This is not for regular driving on roads. If Bugatti is seriously  interested in India it should launch more practicle cars like Jaguar, RR, Bentley etc.
 "
"Exterior The exteriors of this car are very good. They have good design and a pretty long engine. The details of the engine and exterior is not as good as some cars but ok.
Interior (Features, Space   Comfort) The interiors are not very good. The style and colour range of the seats are not good.They are less comfortable but can go good. Adjustments can be made after purchase though. So that is not a big problem.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The engine performance is excellent and the noise of exhaust is excellent. It has a cool 407 km/h top speed with a 1001 metric horsepower engine. The fuel economy is very bad and so for being environment friendly use AC's less in this car.The gear box in this car is preferable and a 10 gear should be fitted to topple the power and speed of the car.
Ride Quality   Handling The ride quality is excellent and at least a test drive should be taken.The handling is excellent if you are an expert at driving.
Final Words The car is excellent but should be at a lower price.
Areas of improvement The interiors and fuel econonmy should be better."
